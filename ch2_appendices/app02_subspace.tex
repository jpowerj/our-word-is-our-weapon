\noindent Given the subcorpora defined in the previous section, we utilized the following procedures to generate a set of terms, each with a corresponding importance score (used for weighting the vectors in the embedding spaces), comprising that subcorpora's ``induced'' discursive subspace within the larger embedding space:

\subsection{Two-Class Comparison via Relative Frequencies}

\subsection{Two-Class Comparison via Machine Learning}

\subsection{Multi-Class Comparison via cTF-IDF}
