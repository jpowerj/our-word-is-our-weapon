    We use book translations as a new measure of international idea flows and
  study the effects of Communism's collapse in Eastern Europe on these flows.
  Using novel data on 800,000 translations and difference-in-differences
  approaches, we show that while translations between Communist languages
  decreased by two thirds with the collapse, Western-to-Communist translations
  increased by a factor of 4 and quickly converged to Western levels.
  Convergence was more pronounced in the fields of applied and social sciences,
  and was more complete in Satellite and Baltic than in Soviet countries. We
  discuss how these patterns help us understand how repressive institutions and
  preferences towards Western European ideas shaped the international diffusion
  of knowledge.%

    We develop a theory of political transitions inspired by the experiences of
  Western Europe and Latin America. Nondemocratic societies are controlled by a
  rich elite. The initially disenfranchised poor can contest power by
  threatening revolution, especially when the opportunity cost is low, for
  example, during recessions. The threat of revolution may force the elite to
  democratize. Democracy may not consolidate because it is redistributive, and
  so gives the elite an incentive to mount a coup. Highly unequal societies are
  less likely to consolidate democracy, and may end up oscillating between
  regimes and suffer substantial fiscal volatility.%

    Since the first wave of uprisings in 2011, the euphoria of the "Arab
  Spring" has given way to the gloom of backlash and a descent into mayhem and
  war. The revolution has been overwhelmed by clashes between rival
  counter-revolutionary forces: resilient old regimes on the one hand and
  Islamic fundamentalist contenders on the other. In this eagerly awaited book,
  foremost Arab world and international affairs specialist Gilbert Achcar
  analyzes the factors of the regional relapse. Focusing on Syria and Egypt,
  Achcar assesses the present stage of the uprising and the main obstacles,
  both regional and international, that prevent any resolution. In Syria, the
  regime's brutality has fostered the rise of jihadist forces, among which the
  so-called Islamic State emerged as the most ruthless and powerful. In Egypt,
  the Muslim Brotherhood's year in power was ultimately terminated by the
  contradictory conjunction of a second revolutionary wave and a bloody
  reactionary coup. Events in Syria and Egypt offer salient examples of a
  pattern of events happening across the Middle East. Morbid Symptoms offers a
  timely analysis of the ongoing Arab uprising that will engage experts and
  general readers alike. Drawing on a unique combination of scholarly and
  political knowledge of the Arab region, Achcar argues that, short of radical
  social change, the region will not achieve stability any time soon.%

    Contracts are the main medium through which people and legal entities
  formalise their trade relations, be they the exchange of goods or the
  specification of mutual obligations. While electronic contracts allow
  automated processes to verify their correctness, most agreements in the real
  world are still encoded in contracts written in natural language,
  necessitating substantial human revision effort to eliminate possible
  conflicting statements, especially for long and complex contracts. We
  demonstrate the {ConCon} (Contract Conflicts) tool, to automatically read
  natural language contracts and indicate potential conflicts among their
  clauses. Using our tool, legal professionals and the general public can
  benefit from a ranking of potential conflicts between the clauses in a
  contract, saving time and effort from legal experts in contract
  proof-reading.%

    This is the work in which Louis Althusser formulated some of his most
  influential ideas. For Marx, first published in France in 1968, has come to
  be regarded as the founding text of the school of “structuralist Marxism”
  which was presided over by the fascinating and enigmatic figure of Louis
  Althusser. Structuralism constituted an intellectual revolution in the 1960s
  and 1970s and radically transformed the way philosophy, political and social
  theory, history, science, and aesthetics were discussed and thought about.
  For Marx was a key contribution to that process and it fundamentally recast
  the way in which many people understood Marx and Marxism.This book contains
  the classic statements of Althusser's analysis of the young Marx and the
  importance of Feuerbach during this formative period, of his thesis of the
  “epistomological break” between the early and the late Marx, and of his
  conception of dialectics, contradiction and “overdetermination.” Also
  included is a study of the materialist theater of Bertolazzi and Brecht and
  the critique of humanist readings of Marxism. Since his death in 1990,
  Althusser's legacy has come under renewed examination and it is increasingly
  recognized that the influence of his ideas has been wider and deeper than
  previously thought: reading For Marx, in its audacity, originality and rigor,
  will explain why this impact was so significant.%

    A classic work of Marxist analysis, available unabridged for the first
  {timeOriginally} published in 1965, Reading Capital is a landmark of French
  thought and radical theory, reconstructing Western Marxism from its
  foundations. Louis Althusser, the French Marxist philosopher, maintained that
  Marx’s project could only be revived if its scientific and revolutionary
  novelty was thoroughly divested of all traces of humanism, idealism,
  Hegelianism and historicism. In order to complete this critical rereading,
  Althusser and his students at the École normale supérieure ran a seminar on
  Capital, re-examining its arguments, strengths and weaknesses in detail, and
  it was out of those discussions that this book was born. Previously only
  available in English in highly abridged form, this edition, appearing fifty
  years after its original publication in France, restores chapters by Roger
  Establet, Pierre Macherey and Jacques Rancière. It includes a major new
  introduction by Étienne Balibar.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In Marx at the Margins, Kevin Anderson uncovers a variety of extensive but
  neglected texts by the well-known political economist which cast what we
  thought we knew about his work in a startlingly different light. Analyzing a
  variety of Marx’s writings, including journalistic work written for the New
  York Tribune, Anderson presents us with a Marx quite at odds with our
  conventional interpretations. Rather than providing us with an account of
  Marx as an exclusively class-based thinker, Anderson here offers a portrait
  of Marx for the twenty-first century: a global theorist whose social critique
  was sensitive to the varieties of human social and historical development,
  including not just class, but nationalism, race, and ethnicity, as well. Marx
  at the Margins ultimately argues that alongside his overarching critique of
  capital, Marx created a theory of history that was multi-layered and not
  easily reduced to a single model of development or revolution. Through
  highly-informed readings on work ranging from Marx’s unpublished 1879–82
  notebooks to his passionate writings about the antislavery cause in the
  United States, this volume delivers a groundbreaking and canon-changing
  vision of Karl Marx that is sure to provoke lively debate in Marxist
  scholarship and beyond.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    New ways of doing things often get started through the actions of a few
  innovators, then diffuse rapidly as more and more people come into contact
  with prior adopters in their social network. Much of the literature focuses
  on the speed of diffusion as a function of the network topology. In practice,
  the topology may not be known with any precision, and it is constantly in
  flux as links are formed and severed. Here, we establish an upper bound on
  the expected waiting time until a given proportion of the population has
  adopted that holds independently of the network structure. Kreindler and
  Young (2014) demonstrated such a bound for regular networks when agents
  choose between two options: the innovation and the status quo. Our bound
  holds for directed and undirected networks of arbitrary size and degree
  distribution, and for multiple competing innovations with different payoffs.%

    This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the effects of the law and
  economics movement on the U.S. justice system using the universe of opinions
  in U.S. Circuit Courts from 1891 and 1 million District Court criminal
  sentencing decisions linked to judge identity. We use attendance in a
  controversial economics training program that 40\% of federal judges attended
  by 1990, a policy change giving judges more sentencing discretion, random
  assignment of judges to control for court- and case-level factors, an
  exogenous seating network from random panel composition to trace the spread
  of economic reasoning in law, and ordering of cases within Circuit to
  identify memetic economic ideas that move across legal topics. We find that
  judges who use law and economics language vote for and author conservative
  verdicts in economics cases and are more opposed to government regulation and
  criminal appeals. After attending Henry Manne's economics training program,
  judges use more economics language and render conservative verdicts in
  economics cases and reject criminal appeals, and this result is robust to a
  large set of judge biographical controls. Manne economics training is more
  predictive of these decisions than political party. Manne judges render 20\%
  harsher (10 months longer) criminal sentences after U.S. v. Booker allowed
  more sentencing discretion. They also impact criminal appeals verdicts when
  not authoring the opinion. Judges exposed to Manne peers increase their use
  of economics language in subsequent opinions. Ideas such as “optimal
  deterrence”, “capital”, and “law and economics” move across legal
  topics.%

    Ever since the discovery of Marx's Early Writings, most of the literature
  concerned with Marx's intellectual development has centred around the
  so-called gap between the 'young' Marx, who was considered to be a humanist
  thinker, and the 'older' Marx, who was held to be a determinist with little
  concern for anything outside his narrow theory of historical materialism. Dr
  Avineri claims that such a gap between the 'young' and 'older' Marx did not
  exist. He supports his claim by a detailed study of the whole corpus of
  Marx's writing on social and political thought.%

    How did the French Revolution become thinkable? Keith Michael Baker, a
  leading authority on the ideological origins of the French Revolution,
  explores this question in his wide-ranging collection of essays. Analyzing
  the new politics of contestation that transformed the traditional political
  culture of the Old Regime during its last decades, Baker revises our
  historical map of the political space in which the French Revolution took
  form. Some essays study the ways in which the revolutionaries' break with the
  past was prepared by competition between agents and critics of absolute
  monarchy to control the cultural resources and political meanings of French
  sought before 1789 to reconstitute their body politic; and by the invention
  of 'public opinion' as a new form of political authority displacing notions
  of 'representation', 'constitution', 'sovereignty' - and of 'the French
  Revolution' itself - the ambiguities, tensions, and contradictions that were
  to drive the revolutionary dynamic in subsequent years. The result is a
  substantial and unified set of studies, stimulating renewed reflection on one
  of the central themes in modern European history.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Statism and Anarchy is a complete English translation of the last work by
  the great Russian anarchist Michael Bakunin. It was written in 1873, in the
  aftermath of the rise of the German Empire and the clash between Bakunin and
  Karl Marx in the first International. Bakunin assesses the strength of a
  European state system dominated by Bismarck. Then, in the most remarkable
  part of the book, he assails the Marxist alternative, predicting that a
  "dictatorship of the proletariat" will in fact be a dictatorship over the
  proletariat, and will produce a new class of socialist rulers. Instead, he
  outlines his vision of an anarchist society and identifies the social forces
  he believes will achieve an ananarchist revolution. Statism and Anarchy had
  an immediate influence on the "to the people" movement of Russian populism,
  and Bakunin's ideas inspired other anarchist movements. This is the only
  complete and reliable rendition of Statism and Anarchy in English, and in a
  lucid introduction Marshall Shatz locates Bakunin in his immediate historical
  and intellectual context, and assesses the impact of his ideas on the wider
  development of European radical thought. A guide to further reading and a
  chronology of events are appended as aids to students encountering Bakunin's
  thought for the first time.%

    Several large scale data mining applications, such as text categorization
  and gene expression analysis, involve high-dimensional data that is also
  inherently directional in nature. Often such data is L2 normalized so that it
  lies on the surface of a unit hypersphere. Popular models such as (mixtures
  of) multi-variate Gaussians are inadequate for characterizing such data. This
  paper proposes a generative mixture-model approach to clustering directional
  data based on the von Mises-Fisher ({vMF}) distribution, which arises
  naturally for data distributed on the unit hypersphere. In particular, we
  derive and analyze two variants of the Expectation Maximization ({EM})
  framework for estimating the mean and concentration parameters of this
  mixture. Numerical estimation of the concentration parameters is non-trivial
  in high dimensions since it involves functional inversion of ratios of Bessel
  functions. We also formulate two clustering algorithms corresponding to the
  variants of {EM} that we derive. Our approach provides a theoretical basis
  for the use of cosine similarity that has been widely employed by the
  information retrieval community, and obtains the spherical kmeans algorithm
  (kmeans with cosine similarity) as a special case of both variants. Empirical
  results on clustering of high-dimensional text and gene-expression data based
  on a mixture of {vMF} distributions show that the ability to estimate the
  concentration parameter for each {vMF} component, which is not present in
  existing approaches, yields superior results, especially for difficult
  clustering tasks in high-dimensional spaces.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The French Revolution brought principles of “liberty, equality,
  fraternity” to bear on the day-to-day challenges of governing what was then
  the largest country in Europe. Its experiments provided a model for future
  revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern
  revolution had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates
  held in the Revolution’s first parliament, we present a quantitative
  analysis of how this body managed innovation. We use information theory to
  track the creation, transmission, and destruction of word-use patterns across
  over 40,000 speeches and a thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was
  biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers’ individual
  qualities could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at
  higher rates, while speakers on the right acted to preserve prior patterns.
  Key players such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abbé Maury (on the right)
  played information-processing roles emblematic of their politics. Newly
  created organizational functions—such as the Assembly president and
  committee chairs—had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a distinct
  transition appears midway through the parliament when committees, external to
  the debate process, gained new powers to “propose and dispose.” Taken
  together, these quantitative results align with existing qualitative
  interpretations, but also reveal crucial information-processing dynamics that
  have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public’s attention,
  but deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the committee system
  gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.%

    A large class of entity extraction tasks from text that is either
  semistructured or fully unstructured may be addressed by regular expressions,
  because in many practical cases the relevant entities follow an underlying
  syntactical pattern and this pattern may be described by a regular
  expression. In this work, we consider the long-standing problem of
  synthesizing such expressions automatically, based solely on examples of the
  desired behavior. We present the design and implementation of a system
  capable of addressing extraction tasks of realistic complexity. Our system is
  based on an evolutionary procedure carefully tailored to the specific needs
  of regular expression generation by examples. The procedure executes a search
  driven by a multiobjective optimization strategy aimed at simultaneously
  improving multiple performance indexes of candidate solutions while at the
  same time ensuring an adequate exploration of the huge solution space. We
  assess our proposal experimentally in great depth, on a number of challenging
  datasets. The accuracy of the obtained solutions seems to be adequate for
  practical usage and improves over earlier proposals significantly. Most
  importantly, our results are highly competitive even with respect to human
  operators. A prototype is available as a web application at {\textless};uri

    Researchers in information science and related areas have developed various
  methods for analyzing textual data, such as survey responses. This article
  describes the application of analysis methods from two distinct fields, one
  method from interpretive social science and one method from statistical
  machine learning, to the same survey data. The results show that the two
  analyses produce some similar and some complementary insights about the
  phenomenon of interest, in this case, nonuse of social media. We compare both
  the processes of conducting these analyses and the results they produce to
  derive insights about each method's unique advantages and drawbacks, as well
  as the broader roles that these methods play in the respective fields where
  they are often used. These insights allow us to make more informed decisions
  about the tradeoffs in choosing different methods for analyzing textual data.
  Furthermore, this comparison suggests ways that such methods might be
  combined in novel and compelling ways.%

    This article analyzes Martin Luther’s role in spreading the early
  Reformation, one of the most important episodes of radical institutional
  change in the last millennium. We argue that social relations played a key
  role in its diffusion because the spread of heterodox ideologies and their
  eventual institutionalization relied not only on private “infection”
  through exposure to innovation but also on active conversion and promotion of
  that new faith through personal ties. We conceive of that process as
  leader-to-follower directional influence originating with Luther and flowing
  to local elites through personal ties. Based on novel data on Luther’s
  correspondence, Luther’s visits, and student enrollments in Luther’s city
  of Wittenberg, we reconstruct Luther’s influence network to examine whether
  local connections to him increased the odds of adopting Protestantism. Using
  regression analyses and simulations based on empirical network data, we find
  that the combination of personal/relational diffusion via Luther’s
  multiplex ties and spatial/structural diffusion via trade routes fostered
  cities’ adoption of the Reformation, making possible Protestantism’s
  early breakthrough from a regional movement to a general rebellion against
  the Roman Catholic Church.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Histories of German philosophy in the nineteenth century typically focus on
  its first half—when Hegel, idealism, and Romanticism dominated. By
  contrast, the remainder of the century, after Hegel's death, has been
  relatively neglected because it has been seen as a period of stagnation and
  decline. But Frederick Beiser argues that the second half of the century was
  in fact one of the most revolutionary periods in modern philosophy because
  the nature of philosophy itself was up for grabs and the very absence of
  certainty led to creativity and the start of a new era. In this innovative
  concise history of German philosophy from 1840 to 1900, Beiser focuses not on
  themes or individual thinkers but rather on the period’s five great
  debates: the identity crisis of philosophy, the materialism controversy, the
  methods and limits of history, the pessimism controversy, and the
  Ignorabimusstreit. Schopenhauer and Wilhelm Dilthey play important roles in
  these controversies but so do many neglected figures, including Ludwig
  Büchner, Eugen Dühring, Eduard von Hartmann, Julius Fraunstaedt, Hermann
  Lotze, Adolf Trendelenburg, and two women, Agnes Taubert and Olga Pluemacher,
  who have been completely forgotten in histories of philosophy. The result is
  a wide-ranging, original, and surprising new account of German philosophy in
  the critical period between Hegel and the twentieth century.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their
  self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence
  length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an
  attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy
  to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer's attention
  mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and
  combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention.
  Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we evaluate Longformer on
  character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on
  text8 and enwik8. In contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer
  and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our pretrained Longformer
  consistently outperforms {RoBERTa} on long document tasks and sets new
  state-of-the-art results on {WikiHop} and {TriviaQA}. We finally introduce
  the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder ({LED}), a Longformer variant for supporting
  long document generative sequence-to-sequence tasks, and demonstrate its
  effectiveness on the {arXiv} summarization dataset.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the postcommunist period, political parties in Central and Eastern
  Europe ({CEE}) had to convincingly demonstrate that they are a vital part of
  a functioning democratic society. Well-developed intraparty democracy ({IPD})
  is one way of accomplishing this. By asking what factors are relevant to an
  explanation of {IPD} formation, we present an analytical framework in which
  the formation of {IPD} can be investigated and explore the patterns of {IPD}
  and their determinants. We draw on a newly constructed data set based on
  standardized content analysis, including 129 party statutes from 14 major
  political parties from Hungary, Romania, and Slovakia between 1989 and 2011.
  Relying on unit fixed-effects regression approaches, our analyses suggest
  that especially imperatives related to party origin and Europeanization have
  important implications for the formation of {IPD} within {CEE} parties.%

    First published over fifty years ago, Isaiah Berlin's compelling portrait
  of the father of socialism has long been considered a classic of modern
  scholarship and the best short account written of Marx's life and thought. It
  provides a penetrating, lucid, and comprehensive introduction to Marx as
  theorist of the socialist revolution, illuminating his personality and ideas,
  and concentrating on those which have historically formed the central core of
  Marxism as a theory and practice. Berlin goes on to present an account of
  Marx's life as one of the most influential and incendiary social philosophers
  of the twentieth century and depicts the social and political atmosphere in
  which Marx wrote. This edition includes a new introduction by Alan Ryan which
  traces the place of Berlin's Marx from its pre-World War {II} publication to
  the present, and elucidates why Berlin's portrait, in the midst of voluminous
  writings about Marx, remains the classic account of the personal and
  political side of this monumental figure.%

    A justification is offered for approaching classic works of political
  theory as relevant to problems that concern us. Perennial problems are shown
  to exist in three increasingly controversial senses. First, past authors
  addressed a problem which we can ponder. Second, past authors addressed a
  problem which authors who wrote on these authors also addressed and which we
  can ponder. Third, numerous authors expressed beliefs relevant to a problem
  which we can ponder. The errors identified by opponents of perennial problems
  arise from empirical misjudgements concerning the ways that different authors
  addressed such problems, not from the assumption that such problems exist.%

    Normative texts can be viewed as composed by formal partitions (articles,
  paragraphs, etc.) or by semantic units containing fragments of a regulation
  (provisions). Provisions can be described according to a metadata scheme
  which consists of provision types and their arguments. This semantic
  annotation of a normative text can make the retrieval of norms easier. The
  detection and description of the provisions according to the established
  metadata scheme is an analytic intellectual activity aiming at classifying
  portions of a normative text into provision types and to extract their
  arguments. Automatic facilities supporting this intellectual activity are
  desirable. Particularly, in this paper, two modules able to qualify fragments
  of a normative text in terms of provision types and to extract their
  arguments are presented.%

    Cultural transmission arguably plays an important role in the determination
  of many fundamental preference traits (e.g., discounting, risk aversion and
  altruism) and most cultural traits, social norms, and ideological tenets (
  e.g., attitudes towards family and fertility practices, and attitudes in the
  job market). It is, however, the pervasive evidence of the resilience of
  ethnic and religious traits across generations that motivates a large
  fraction of the theoretical and empirical literature on cultural
  transmission. This article reviews the main contributions of models of
  cultural transmission, from theoretical and empirical perspectives. It
  presents their implications regarding the long-run population dynamics of
  cultural traits and cultural heterogeneity, the world's geographical
  fragmentation by ethic and religious traits, at any given time. Finally, the
  paper reviews the empirical literature which estimates various properties of
  cultural transmission mechanisms as well as the population dynamics of
  specific traits.%

    We describe latent Dirichlet allocation ({LDA}), a generative probabilistic
  model for collections of discrete data such as text corpora. {LDA} is a
  three-level hierarchical Bayesian model, in which each item of a collection
  is modeled as a finite mixture over an underlying set of topics. Each topic
  is, in turn, modeled as an infinite mixture over an underlying set of topic
  probabilities. In the context of text modeling, the topic probabilities
  provide an explicit representation of a document. We present efficient
  approximate inference techniques based on variational methods and an {EM}
  algorithm for empirical Bayes parameter estimation. We report results in
  document modeling, text classification, and collaborative filtering,
  comparing to a mixture of unigrams model and the probabilistic {LSI} model.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In this novel introduction to modern microeconomic theory, Samuel Bowles
  returns to the classical economists' interest in the wealth and poverty of
  nations and people, the workings of the institutions of capitalist economies,
  and the coevolution of individual preferences and the structures of markets,
  firms, and other institutions. Using recent advances in evolutionary game
  theory, contract theory, behavioral experiments, and the modeling of dynamic
  processes, he develops a theory of how economic institutions shape individual
  behavior, and how institutions evolve due to individual actions,
  technological change, and chance events. Topics addressed include
  institutional innovation, social preferences, nonmarket social interactions,
  social capital, equilibrium unemployment, credit constraints, economic power,
  generalized increasing returns, disequilibrium outcomes, and path dependency.
  Each chapter is introduced by empirical puzzles or historical episodes
  illuminated by the modeling that follows, and the book closes with sets of
  problems to be solved by readers seeking to improve their mathematical
  modeling skills. Complementing standard mathematical analysis are agent-based
  computer simulations of complex evolving systems that are available online so
  that readers can experiment with the models. Bowles concludes with the
  time-honored challenge of "getting the rules right," providing an evaluation
  of markets, states, and communities as contrasting and yet sometimes
  synergistic structures of governance. Must reading for students and scholars
  not only in economics but across the behavioral sciences, this engagingly
  written and compelling exposition of the new microeconomics moves the field
  beyond the conventional models of prices and markets toward a more accurate
  and policy-relevant portrayal of human social behavior.%

    This is the first major study of Marx and the Young Hegelians in twenty
  years. The book offers a new interpretation of Marx's early development, the
  political dimension of Young Hegelianism, and that movement's relationship to
  political and intellectual currents in early nineteenth-century Germany.
  Warren Breckman challenges the orthodox distinction drawn between the
  exclusively religious concerns of Hegelians in the 1830s and the
  sociopolitical preoccupations of the 1840s. He shows that there are
  inextricable connections between the theological, political and social
  discourses of the Hegelians in the 1830s. The book draws together an account
  of major figures such as Feuerbach and Marx, with discussions of lesser-known
  but significant figures such as Eduard Gans, August Cieszkowski, Moses Hess,
  F.W.J. Schelling as well as such movements as French Saint-Simonianism and
  'positive philosophy'. Wide-ranging in scope and synthetic in approach, this
  is an important book for historians of philosophy, theology, political theory
  and nineteenth-century ideas.%

    Friedrich Nietzsche was immensely influential and, counter to most
  expectations, also very well read. An essential new reference tool for those
  interested in his thinking, Nietzsche’s Philosophical Context identifies
  the chronology and huge range of philosophical books that engaged him.
  Rigorously examining the scope of this reading, Thomas H. Brobjer consulted
  over two thousand volumes in Nietzsche’s personal library, as well as his
  book bills, library records, journals, letters, and publications. This
  meticulous investigation also considers many of the annotations in his books.
  In arguing that Nietzsche’s reading often constituted the starting point
  for, or counterpoint to, much of his own thinking and writing, Brobjer’s
  study provides scholars with fresh insight into how Nietzsche worked and
  thought; to which questions and thinkers he responded; and by which of them
  he was influenced. The result is a new and much more contextual understanding
  of Nietzsche's life and thinking.%

    Under what conditions did the first Islamist movements organize? Which
  social and institutional contexts facilitated such mobilization? A sizable
  literature points to social and demographic changes, Western encroachment
  into Muslim societies, and the availability of state and economic
  infrastructure. To test these hypotheses, we match a listing of Muslim
  Brotherhood branches founded in interwar Egypt with contemporaneous census
  data on over 4,000 subdistricts. A multilevel analysis shows that Muslim
  Brotherhood branches were more likely in subdistricts connected to the
  railway and where literacy was higher. Branches were less likely in districts
  with large European populations, and where state administration was more
  extensive. Qualitative evidence also points to the railway as key to the
  movement’s propagation. These findings challenge the orthodoxy that contact
  between Muslims and the West spurred the growth of organized political Islam,
  and instead highlight the critical role of economic and state infrastructure
  in patterning the early contexts of Islamist activism.%

    This article estimates the development of manuscripts and printed books in
  Western Europe over the course of thirteen centuries. As these estimates
  show, medieval and early modern book production was a dynamic economic
  sector, with an average annual growth rate of around one percent. Rising
  production after the middle of the fifteenth century probably resulted from
  lower book prices and higher literacy. To explain the dynamics of medieval
  book production, we provide estimates for urbanization rates and for the
  numbers of universities and monasteries. Monasteries seem to have been most
  important in the early period, while universities and laypeople dominated the
  later medieval demand for books.%

    This chapter provides a first precise picture of the French reception of
  Ricardo's works and ideas. It devotes to more specific topics: value and
  wealth, rent, money and banking and Say's law of markets and crises. The
  reception of the works of David Ricardo in the French language stands in
  sharp contrast to what happened in England. The chapter explains the critical
  tone of the reception of the works of Ricardo in this respect Malthus was
  more fortunate with his principle of population and his principles of
  political economy, on many points closer to the French ideas and approaches.
  Fonteyraud, who contacted and visited Ricardo's family for this work, added a
  long and interesting introduction to this collection on which more below

    Our goal is to use formal methods to analyse normative documents written in
  English, such as privacy policies and service-level agreements. This requires
  the combination of a number of different elements, including information
  extraction from natural language, formal languages for model representation,
  and an interface for property specification and verification. We have worked
  on a collection of components for this task: a natural language extraction
  tool, a suitable formalism for representing such documents, an interface for
  building models in this formalism, and methods for answering queries asked of
  a given model. In this work, each of these concerns is brought together in a
  web-based tool, providing a single interface for analysing normative texts in
  English. Through the use of a running example, we describe each component and
  demonstrate the workflow established by our tool.%

    Marx was a highly original and polymathic thinker, unhampered by
  disciplinary boundaries, whose intellectual influence has been enormous. Yet
  in the wake of the collapse of Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe the
  question arises as to how important his work really is for us now. An
  important dimension of this volume is to place Marx's writings in their
  historical context and to separate what he actually said from what others (in
  particular, Engels) interpreted him as saying. Informed by current debates
  and new perspectives, the volume provides a comprehensive coverage of all the
  major areas to which Marx made significant contributions.%

    The German Ideology as a 'book' dates only from the early 1920s and 1930s.
  The opening 'chapter' 'I. Feuerbach' was factitiously constructed to solve
  the problem posed by Marx's engimatic reference in 1859 to
  'self-clarification'. This was in autobiographical passages detailing his
  'outlook', termed by Engels the 'materialist interpretation of history'.
  Factual evidence presented here makes this framing untenable. 'The German
  ideology' manuscript materials of 1845–6 are best studied — not as a
  'smooth text' of the 'last hand' — but as a 'variant-rich' text that allows
  access to a 'laboratory' where Marx and Engels were learning to think as they
  did.%

    This book examines the life and works of Friedrich Engels during the decade
  before he entered a political partnership with Karl Marx. It takes a thematic
  approach in three substantial chapters: Imagination, Observation, and
  Vocation. Throughout, the reader sees the world from Engels’s perspective,
  not knowing how his story will turn out. This approach reveals the
  multifaceted and ambitious character of young Friedrich’s achievements from
  age sixteen till just turning twenty-five. At the time that he accepted
  Marx’s invitation to co-author a short political satire, Engels was far
  better known and much more accomplished. He had published many more articles
  on far more subjects, in both German and English, than Marx had managed.
  Moreover, he had written a critique of political economy from a perspective
  unique in the German context, and published his own pioneering and
  substantial study of working class conditions in an industrializing economy.
  Offering an innovative approach to a largely neglected period of Engels’s
  life before meeting Marx, Carver upends standard narratives in existing
  biographical studies of Engels to reveal him as an important figure not just
  in relation to his more famous collaborator, but a key voice in the
  liberal-democratic, constitutional and nation-building revolutionism of the
  1830s and 1840s.%

    In this work we illustrate a novel approach for solving an information
  extraction problem on legal texts. It is based on Natural Language Processing
  techniques and on the adoption of a formalization that allows coupling domain
  knowledge and syntactic information. The proposed approach is applied to
  extend an existing system to assist human annotators in handling normative
  modificatory provisions ---that are the changes to other normative texts---.
  Such laws 'versioning' problem is a hard and relevant one. We provide a
  linguistic and legal analysis of a particular case of modificatory provision
  (the efficacy suspension), show how such knowledge can be formalized in a
  linguistic resource such as {FrameNet}, and used by the semantic
  interpreter.%

    We study how contract element extraction can be automated. We provide a
  labeled dataset with gold contract element annotations, along with an
  unlabeled dataset of contracts that can be used to pre-train word embeddings.
  Both datasets are provided in an encoded form to bypass privacy issues. We
  describe and experimentally compare several contract element extraction
  methods that use manually written rules and linear classifiers (logistic
  regression, {SVMs}) with hand-crafted features, word embeddings, and
  part-of-speech tag embeddings. The best results are obtained by a hybrid
  method that combines machine learning (with hand-crafted features and
  embeddings) and manually written post-processing rules.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Reknowned historian Roger Chartier, one of the most brilliant and
  productive of the younger generation of French writers and scholars now at
  work refashioning the Annales tradition, attempts in this book to analyze the
  causes of the French revolution not simply by investigating its “cultural
  origins” but by pinpointing the conditions that “made is possible because
  conceivable.”Chartier has set himself two important tasks. First, while
  acknowledging the seminal contribution of Daniel Mornet’s Les origens
  intellectuelles de la Révolution française (1935), he synthesizes the
  half-century of scholarship that has created a sociology of culture for
  Revolutionary France, from education reform through widely circulated printed
  literature to popular expectations of government and society. Chartier goes
  beyond Mornet’s work, not be revising that classic text but by raising
  questions that would not have occurred to its author.Chartier’s second
  contribution is to reexamine the conventional wisdom that there is a
  necessary link between the profound cultural transformation of the eighteenth
  century (generally characterized as the Enlightenment) and the abrupt
  Revolutionary rupture of 1789. The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution
  is a major work by one of the leading scholars in the field and is likely to
  set the intellectual agenda for future work on the subject.%

    "In 1971, at the height of the Vietnam War and at a time of great political
  and social instability, two of the world's leading intellectuals, Noam
  Chomsky and Michel Foucault, were invited by Dutch philosopher Fons Elders to
  debate an age-old question: is there such a thing as "innate" human nature
  independent of our experiences and external influences? The resulting
  dialogue is one of the most original, provocative, and spontaneous exchanges
  to have occurred between contemporary philosophers, and above all serves as a
  concise introduction to their basic theories. What begins as a philosophical
  argument rooted in linguistics (Chomsky) and the theory of knowledge
  (Foucault), soon evolves into a broader discussion encompassing a wide range
  of topics, from science, history, and behaviorism to creativity, freedom, and
  the struggle for justice in the realm of politics. In addition to the debate
  itself, this volume features a newly written introduction by noted Foucault
  scholar John Rajchman and includes substantial additional texts by Chomsky
  and Foucault."--Publisher's website.%

    A new biography of Karl Marx, tracing the life of this titanic figure and
  the legacy of his work Karl Marx remains the most influential and
  controversial political thinker in history. He died quietly in 1883 and a
  mere eleven mourners attended his funeral, but a year later he was being
  hailed as "the Prophet himself" whose name and writings would "endure through
  the ages." He has been viewed as a philosopher, economist, historian,
  sociologist, political theorist, even a literary craftsman. But who was Marx?
  What informed his critiques of modern society? And how are we to understand
  his legacy? In Marx and Marxism, Gregory Claeys, a leading historian of
  socialism, offers a wide-ranging, accessible account of Marx's ideas and
  their development, from the nineteenth century through the Russian Revolution
  to the present. After the collapse of the Soviet Union his reputation seemed
  utterly eclipsed, but now a new generation is reading and discovering Marx in
  the wake of the recurrent financial crises, growing social inequality, and an
  increasing sense of the injustice and destructiveness of capitalism. Both his
  critique of capitalism and his vision of the future speak across the
  centuries to our times, even if the questions he poses are more difficult to
  answer than ever.%

    The nineteenth century was seemingly a period of great progress. Huge
  advancements and achievements were made in science, technology and industry
  that transformed life and work alike. But a growing pride in modernity and
  innovation was tainted by a sense of the loss of the past and the multiple
  threats which novelty posed. The Cambridge Companion to Nineteenth-Century
  Thought provides an impressive survey of the period's major ideas and trends.
  Leading scholars explore some of the most influential concepts and debates
  within philosophy, history, political thought, economics, religion and the
  social sciences, as well as feminism and imperialism. Some of these debates
  continued into the following century and many still remain relevant in the
  present day. This Companion is an excellent tool for readers seeking to
  understand the genesis of modern discourse across a range of humanities and

    Alfred Cobban's The Social Interpretation of the French Revolution is one
  of the acknowledged classics of post-war historiography. This 'revisionist'
  analysis of the French Revolution caused a furore on first publication in
  1964, challenging as it did established orthodoxies during the crucial period
  of the Cold War. Cobban saw the French Revolution as central to the 'grand
  narrative of modern history', but provided a salutary corrective to many
  celebrated social explanations, determinist and otherwise, of its origins and
  development. A generation later this concise but powerful intervention was
  reissued in this 1999 edition with an introduction by Gwynne Lewis, providing
  students with both a context for Cobban's own arguments, and assessing the
  course of Revolutionary studies in the wake of The Social Interpretation.
  This book remains a handbook of revisionism for Anglo-Saxon scholars, and is
  essential reading for all students of French history at undergraduate level
  and above.%

    The method of interpreting political theory in relation to its specific
  historical contexts offers particular insight into the work of Karl Marx.
  When pre-capitalist societies are understood in relation to Marx's rigorously
  conceived capitalist mode of production, it is apparent that the context in
  which Marx produced his very earliest work was itself pre-capitalist. It can
  then be recognized that Marx began by making a significant contribution to an
  existing framework of critical political theory but also that, following a
  critical confrontation with English political economy in 1844, he opened new
  avenues of thought in relation to a new context: capitalism.%

    This book considers Karl Marx’s ideas in relation to the social and
  political context in which he lived and wrote. It emphasizes both the
  continuity of his commitment to the cause of full human emancipation, and the
  role of his critique of political economy in conceiving history to be the
  history of class struggles. The book follows his developing ideas from before
  he encountered political economy, through the politics of 1848 and the
  Bonapartist “farce,”, the maturation of the critique of political economy
  in the Grundrisse and Capital, and his engagement with the politics of the
  First International and the legacy of the Paris Commune. Notwithstanding
  errors in historical judgment largely reflecting the influence of dominant
  liberal historiography, Marx laid the foundations for a new social theory
  premised upon the historical consequences of alienation and the potential for
  human freedom.%

    As an old Scottish proverb says, “give a Dog an ill Name, and he’ll
  soon be hanged.” Even when the signal has little to do with underlying
  reality, endorsement—or contempt—can produce lasting consequences for a
  person’s social position. The ease with which such pieces of folk wisdom
  translate across both time and species suggests that there is a general, and
  even perhaps universal, logic to hierarchies and how they form. Kawakatsu et
  al. (1) make an important advance in the quest for this kind of
  understanding, providing a general model for how subtle differences in
  individual-level decision-making can lead to hard-to-miss consequences for
  society as a whole. Their work (1) reveals two distinct regimes—one
  egalitarian, one hierarchical—that emerge from shifts in individual-level
  judgment. These lead to statistical methods that researchers can use to
  reverse engineer observed hierarchies, and understand how signaling systems
  work when prestige and power are in play. The results make a singular
  contribution at the intersection of two distinct traditions of research into
  social power: the mechanistic (how hierarchies get made) and the functional
  (the adaptive roles they can play in society). Hierarchies were first
  understood mechanistically, as pecking orders that were the cumulative
  consequence of individual aggressive acts (2). Researchers focused on how to
  translate aggression (e.g., physical harm) or endorsement (e.g., signals of
  submission) into rank. Ideally, aggression and rank should be consistent. If
  A ranked above B, one wanted no aggressive acts from B to A, or submissive
  acts from A to B. Cycles frustrated this goal (A might aggress against B, B
  against C, and C against A), and so a next step adjusted the final ranks to
  minimize both the number and the strength of the inconsistencies (3). These
  methods produced holistic assessments: The relative rank of A and B depended,

    Despite the popularity of unsupervised techniques for political science
  text-as-data research, the importance and implications of preprocessing
  decisions in this domain have received scant systematic attention. Yet, as we
  show, such decisions have profound effects on the results of real models for
  real data. We argue that substantive theory is typically too vague to be of
  use for feature selection, and that the supervised literature is not
  necessarily a helpful source of advice. To aid researchers working in
  unsupervised settings, we introduce a statistical procedure and software that
  examines the sensitivity of findings under alternate preprocessing regimes.
  This approach complements a researcher’s substantive understanding of a
  problem by providing a characterization of the variability changes in
  preprocessing choices may induce when analyzing a particular dataset. In
  making scholars aware of the degree to which their results are likely to be
  sensitive to their preprocessing decisions, it aids replication efforts.%

    We introduce a new language representation model called {BERT}, which
  stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike
  recent language representation models, {BERT} is designed to pre-train deep
  bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on
  both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained
  {BERT} model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to
  create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question
  answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific
  architecture modifications. {BERT} is conceptually simple and empirically
  powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language
  processing tasks, including pushing the {GLUE} score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point
  absolute improvement), {MultiNLI} accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute
  improvement), {SQuAD} v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point
  absolute improvement) and {SQuAD} v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute
  improvement).%

    There are very few figures in history that have exerted as much and as
  varied an influence as Karl Marx. His work represents an unrivalled
  intervention into fields as various as philosophy, journalism, economics,
  history, politics and cultural criticism. His name is invoked across the
  political spectrum in connection to revolution and insurrection, social
  justice and economic transformation. The Bloomsbury Companion to Marx is the
  definitive reference guide to Marx's life and work. Written by an
  international team of leading Marx scholars, the book offers comprehensive
  coverage of Marx's: life and contexts; sources, influences and encounters;
  key writings; major themes and topics; and reception and influence. The
  defining feature of this Companion is its attention to the new directions in
  Marxism that animate the theoretical, scientific, and political sides of
  Marx's thought. Gender and the growing importance of Marxist-feminism is
  treated as equally important to clarifying Marx today as traditional and
  diverse categories of critique such as class, capital, and mode of
  production. Similarly, this Companion showcases the methodological and
  political importance of Marxism to environmentalist politics. Finally, the
  volume examines in detail non-European Marxisms, demonstrating the centrality
  of Marxist thought to political movements both within and beyond the global
  north.This book is the ideal research resource for anyone working on Marx and
  his ideas today, and as an entry point, if you are approaching Marx's thought
  for the first time.%

    Legal texts express conditions in natural language describing what is
  permitted, forbidden or mandatory in the context they regulate. Despite the
  numerous approaches tackling the problem of moving from a natural language
  legal text to the respective set of machine-readable conditions, results are
  still unsatisfiable and it remains a major open challenge. In this paper, we
  propose a preliminary approach which combines different Natural Language
  Processing techniques towards the extraction of rules from legal documents.
  More precisely, we combine the linguistic information provided by {WordNet}
  together with a syntax-based extraction of rules from legal texts, and a
  logic-based extraction of dependencies between chunks of such texts. Such a
  combined approach leads to a powerful solution towards the extraction of
  machine-readable rules from legal documents. We evaluate the proposed
  approach over the Australian " Telecommunications consumer protections code "

    Much of Karl Marx's most important work came out of his critique of other
  thinkers, including many socialists who differed significantly in their
  conceptions of socialism. The fourth volume in Hal Draper's series looks at
  these critiques to illuminate what Marx's socialism was, as well as what it
  was not. Some of these debates are well-known elements in Marx's work, such
  as his writings on the anarchists Proudhon and Bakunin. Others are less
  familiar, such as the writings on "Bismarckian socialism" and "Boulangism,"
  but promise to become better known and understood with Draper's exposition.
  He also discusses the more general ideological tendencies of "utopian" and
  "sentimental" socialisms, which took various forms and were ingredients in
  many different socialist movements.%

    Choosing optimal hyperparameter values for support vector machines is an
  important step in {SVM} design. This is usually done by minimizing either an
  estimate of generalization error or some other related performance measure.
  In this paper, we empirically study the usefulness of several simple
  performance measures that are inexpensive to compute (in the sense that they
  do not require expensive matrix operations involving the kernel matrix). The
  results point out which of these measures are adequate functionals for tuning
  {SVM} hyperparameters. For {SVMs} with L1 soft-margin formulation, none of
  the simple measures yields a performance uniformly as good as k-fold cross
  validation; Joachims’ Xi-Alpha bound and the {GACV} of Wahba et al. come
  next and perform reasonably well. For {SVMs} with L2 soft-margin formulation,
  the radius margin bound gives a very good prediction of optimal
  hyperparameter values.%

    The First Socialist Schism chronicles the conflicts in the International
  Working Men's Association (the First International, 1864-1877), which
  represents an important milestone in the history of political ideas and
  socialist theory. In defending their autonomy, federations in the
  International became aware of what separated them from the social democratic
  movement that relied on the establishment of national labor parties and the
  conquest of political power. This can be seen as a decisive moment in the
  history of political ideas: the split between centralist party politics and
  the federalist grassroots movement. The separate movements in the
  International--which would later develop into social democracy, communism,
  and anarchism--found their greatest advocates in Mikhail Bakunin and Karl
  Marx. However, the significance of this alleged clash of titans is largely a
  modern invention. It was not the rivalry between two arch-enemies or a
  personal vendetta based on mutual resentment that made the conflict between
  Bakunin and Marx so important but rather that it heralded the first socialist
  schism between parliamentary party politics aiming to conquer political power
  and social-revolutionary concepts. Instead of focusing exclusively on what
  Marx and Bakunin said, many other contributions to this debate are examined,
  making this the first reconstruction of a dispute that gripped the entire
  organization. This book also provides the first detailed account of the
  International's Congress of The Hague (September, 1872); including the
  background, the sequence of events, and international reaction. The book sets
  new standards when it comes to source material, taking into account documents
  from numerous archives and libraries that have previously gone unnoticed or
  were completely unknown.%

    Although social and biomedical scientists have long been interested in the
  process through which ideas and behaviors diffuse, the identification of
  causal diffusion effects, also known as peer and contagion effects, remains
  challenging. Many scholars consider the commonly used assumption of no
  omitted confounders to be untenable due to contextual confounding and
  homophily bias. To address this long-standing problem, we examine the causal
  identification under a new assumption of structural stationarity, which
  formalizes the underlying diffusion process with a class of dynamic causal
  directed acyclic graphs. First, we develop a statistical test that can detect
  a wide range of biases, including the two types mentioned above. We then
  propose a difference-in-differences style estimator that can directly correct
  biases under an additional parametric assumption. Leveraging the proposed
  methods, we study the spatial diffusion of hate crimes against refugees in
  Germany. After correcting large upward bias in existing studies, we find hate
  crimes diffuse only to areas that have a high proportion of school dropouts.%

    News editorials argue about political issues in order to challenge or
  reinforce the stance of readers with different ideologies. Previous research
  has investigated such persuasive effects for argumentative content. In
  contrast, this paper studies how important the style of news editorials is to
  achieve persuasion. To this end, we first compare content- and style-oriented
  classifiers on editorials from the liberal {NYTimes} with ideology-specific
  effect annotations. We find that conservative readers are resistant to
  {NYTimes} style, but on liberals, style even has more impact than content.
  Focusing on liberals, we then cluster the leads, bodies, and endings of
  editorials, in order to learn about writing style patterns of effective
  argumentation.%

    A systematic, critical examination of Karl Marx's social theories and their
  philosophical presuppositions. Through extensive discussions of the texts Jon
  Elster offers a balanced and detailed account of Marx's views that is at once
  sympathetic, undogmatic and rigorous. Equally importantly he tries to assess
  'what is living and what is dead in the philosophy of Marx', using the
  analytical resources of contemporary social science and philosophy. Professor
  Elster insists on the need for microfoundations in social science and
  provides a systematic criticism of functionalism and teleological thinking in
  Marx. He argues that Marx's economic theories are largely wrong or
  irrelevant; historical materialism is seen to have only limited plausibility
  (and is not even consistently applied by Marx); Marx's most lasting
  achievements are the criticism of capitalism in terms of alienation and
  exploitation and the theory of class struggle, politics and ideology under
  capitalism, though in these areas too Elster enters substantial
  qualifications. The book should take its place as the most comprehensive and
  sophisticated modern study available.%

    The book proposes a new interpretation of Alexis de Tocqueville that views
  him first and foremost as a social scientist rather than as a political
  theorist. Drawing on his earlier work on the explanation of social behavior,
  Elster argues that Tocqueville's main claim to our attention today rests on
  the large number of exportable causal mechanisms to be found in his work,
  many of which are still worthy of further exploration. Elster proposes a
  novel reading of Democracy in America in which the key explanatory variable
  is the rapid economic and political turnover rather than equality of wealth
  at any given point in time. He also offers a reading of The Ancien Régime
  and the Revolution as grounded in the psychological relations among the
  peasantry, the bourgeoisie, and the nobility. Consistently going beyond
  exegetical commentary, he argues that Tocqueville is eminently worth reading
  today for his substantive and methodological insights.%

    In this new edition of his critically acclaimed book, Jon Elster examines
  the nature of social behavior, proposing choice as the central concept of the
  social sciences. Extensively revised throughout, the book offers an overview
  of key explanatory mechanisms, drawing on many case studies and experiments
  to explore the nature of explanation in the social sciences; an analysis of
  the mental states - beliefs, desires, and emotions - that are precursors to
  action; a systematic comparison of rational-choice models of behavior with
  alternative accounts, and a review of mechanisms of social interaction
  ranging from strategic behavior to collective decision making. A wholly new
  chapter includes an exploration of classical moralists and Proust in charting
  mental mechanisms operating 'behind the back' of the agent, and a new
  conclusion points to the pitfalls and fallacies in current ways of doing
  social science, proposing guidelines for more modest and more robust
  procedures.%

    More of the social world lives within electronic text than ever before,
  from collective activity on the web, social media, and instant messaging to
  online transactions, government intelligence, and digitized libraries. This
  supply of text has elicited demand for natural language processing and
  machine learning tools to filter, search, and translate text into valuable
  data. We survey some of the most exciting computational approaches to text
  analysis, highlighting both supervised methods that extend old theories to
  new data and unsupervised techniques that discover hidden regularities worth
  theorizing. We then review recent research that uses these tools to develop
  social insight by exploring (a) collective attention and reasoning through
  the content of communication; (b) social relationships through the process of
  communication; and (c) social states, roles, and moves identified through
  heterogeneous signals within communication. We highlight social questions for
  which these advances could offer powerful new insight.%

    Marx's first, flawed, attempt at a critique of political economy has

  knowledge of political economy before his reception of Engels' Umrisse; his
  economic reading in the Paris period; and the arguments of the first
  manuscript of the {EPM} itself, showing the absence of Ricardo and the
  pervasive use of Smith's Wealth of Nations, in particular, the division of
  labour, the rent theory, the subsistence wage, and the three states of
  society. The material on estranged labour was envisaged by Marx as an
  explanation of the capitalist economic system superior to that offered by the
  political economists. But his subsequent reading of Ricardo's Principles
  leads Marx to discard the economics of the {EPM}.%

    In recent years, new digital technologies are being used to support the
  navigation and the analysis of scientific publications, justified by the
  increasing number of articles published every year. For this reason, experts
  make use of on-line systems to browse thousands of articles in search of
  relevant information. In this paper, we present a new method that
  automatically assigns meanings to references on the basis of the citation
  text through a Natural Language Processing pipeline and a slightly-supervised
  clustering process. The resulting network of semantically-linked articles
  allows an informed exploration of the research panorama through semantic
  paths. The proposed approach has been validated using the {ACL} Anthology
  Dataset containing several thousands of papers related to the Computational
  Linguistics field. A manual evaluation on the extracted citation meanings
  carried to very high levels of accuracy. Finally, a freely-available
  web-based application has been developed and published on-line.%

    This study exploits the conﬁscation and auctioning oﬀ of Church
  property that occurred during the French Revolution to assess the role played
  by transaction costs in delaying the reallocation of property rights in the
  aftermath of fundamental institutional reform. French districts with a
  greater proportion of land redistributed during the Revolution experienced
  higher levels of agricultural productivity in 1841 and 1852 as well as more
  investment in irrigation and more eﬃcient land use. We trace these
  increases in productivity to an increase in land inequality associated with
  the Revolutionary auction process. We also show how the beneﬁts associated
  with the head-start given to districts with more Church land initially, and
  thus greater land redistribution by auction during the Revolution, dissipated
  over the course of the nineteenth century as other districts gradually
  overcame the transaction costs associated with reallocating the property
  rights associated with the feudal system.%

    This book is a reception study of Karl Marx’s and Friedrich Engels’
  ideas in Britain during the late nineteenth century and a revisionist account
  of the emergence of modern British socialism. It reconstructs how H. M.
  Hyndman, E. B. Bax, and William Morris interacted with Marx and
  ‘Marxism’. It shows how Hyndman was a socialist of liberal and republican
  provenance, rather than the Tory radical he is typically held to be; how Bax
  was a sophisticated thinker and highly influential figure in European
  socialist circles, rather than a negligible pedant; and it shows how
  Morris’s debt to Bax and liberalism has not been given its due. It
  demonstrates how John Stuart Mill, in particular, was combined with Marx in
  Britain; it illuminates other liberal influences which help to explain the
  sectarian attitude adopted by the Social Democratic Federation towards
  organised labour; and it establishes an alternative genealogy for Fabian
  socialism.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Since its publication twenty-five years ago, Free Soil, Free Labor, Free
  Men has been recognized as a classic, an indispensable contribution to our
  understanding of the causes of the American Civil War. A key work in
  establishing political ideology as a major concern of modern American
  historians, it remains the only full-scale evaluation of the ideas of the
  early Republican party. Now with a new introduction, Eric Foner puts his
  argument into the context of contemporary scholarship, reassessing the
  concept of free labor in the light of the last twenty-five years of writing
  on such issues as work, gender, economic change, and political thought.A
  significant reevaluation of the causes of the Civil War, Foner's study looks
  beyond the North's opposition to slavery and its emphasis upon preserving the
  Union to determine the broader grounds of its willingness to undertake a war
  against the South in 1861. Its search is for those social concepts the North
  accepted as vital to its way of life, finding these concepts most clearly
  expressed in the ideology of the growing Republican party in the decade
  before the war's start. Through a careful analysis of the attitudes of
  leading factions in the party's formation (northern Whigs, former Democrats,
  and political abolitionists) Foner is able to show what each contributed to
  Republican ideology. He also shows how northern ideas of human rights--in
  particular a man's right to work where and how he wanted, and to accumulate
  property in his own name--and the goals of American society were implicit in
  that ideology. This was the ideology that permeated the North in the period
  directly before the Civil War, led to the election of Abraham Lincoln, and
  led, almost immediately, to the Civil War itself. At the heart of the
  controversy over the extension of slavery, he argues, is the issue of whether
  the northern or southern form of society would take root in the West, whose
  development would determine the nation's destiny.In his new introductory
  essay, Foner presents a greatly altered view of the subject. Only
  entrepreneurs and farmers were actually "free men" in the sense used in the
  ideology of the period. Actually, by the time the Civil War was initiated,
  half the workers in the North were wage-earners, not independent workers. And
  this did not account for women and blacks, who had little freedom in choosing
  what work they did. He goes onto show that even after the Civil War these
  guarantees for "free soil, free labor, free men" did not really apply for
  most Americans, and especially not for blacks. Demonstrating the profoundly
  successful fusion of value and interest within Republican ideology prior to
  the Civil War, Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men remains a classic of modern
  American historical writing. Eloquent and influential, it shows how this
  ideology provided the moral consensus which allowed the North, for the first
  time in history, to mobilize an entire society in modern warfare.%

    Legislation usually lacks a systematic organization which makes the
  management and the access to norms a hard problem to face. A more analytic
  semantic unit of reference (provision) for legislative texts was identified.
  A model of provisions (provisions types and their arguments) allows to
  describe the semantics of rules in legislative texts. It can be used to
  develop advanced semantic-based applications and services on legislation. In
  this paper an automatic bottom-up strategy to qualify existing legislative
  texts in terms of provision types is described.%

    The French Revolution is an historical event unlike any other. It is more
  than just a topic of intellectual interest: it has become part of a moral and
  political heritage. But after two centuries, this central event in French
  history has usually been thought of in much the same terms as it was by its
  contemporaries. There have been many accounts of the French Revolution, and
  though their opinions differ, they have often been commemorative or
  anniversary interpretations of the original event. The dividing line of
  revolutionary historiography, in intellectual terms, is therefore not between
  the right and the left, but between commemorative and conceptual history, as
  exemplified respectively in the works of Michelet and Tocquevifle. In this
  book, François Furet analyses how an event like the French Revolution can be
  conceptualised, and identifies the radically new changes the Revolution
  produced as well as the continuity it provided, albeit under the appearance
  of change. This question has become a riddle for the European left, answered
  neither by Marx nor by the theorists of our own century. In his analysis of
  the tragic relevance of the Revolution, Furet both refers to contemporary
  experience and discusses various elements in the work of Alexis de
  Tocclueville and that of Augustin Cochin, which has never been systematically
  applied by historians of the Revolution. Furet's book is based on the
  complementary ideas of these two writers in an attempt to cut through the
  apparent and misleading clarity of various contradictory views of the
  Revolution, and to help decipher some of the enigmatic problems of
  revolutionary ideology. It will be of value to historians of modern Europe
  and their students; to political, social and economic historians; to
  sociologists; and to students of political thought.%

    Brilliantly researched and wonderfully written, Love and Capital reveals
  the rarely glimpsed and heartbreakingly human side of the man whose works
  would redefine the world after his death.Drawing upon previously unpublished
  material, acclaimed biographer Mary Gabriel tells the story of Karl and Jenny
  Marx's marriage. Through it, we see Karl as never before: a devoted father
  and husband, a prankster who loved a party, a dreadful procrastinator,
  freeloader, and man of wild enthusiasms -- one of which would almost destroy
  his marriage. Through years of desperate struggle, Jenny's love for Karl
  would be tested again and again as she waited for him to finish his
  masterpiece, Capital.An epic narrative that stretches over decades to recount
  Karl and Jenny's story against the backdrop of Europe's Nineteenth Century,
  Love {andCapital} is a surprising and magisterial account of romance and
  revolution -- and of one of the great love stories of all time.%

    While generative models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation ({LDA}) have
  proven fruitful in topic modeling, they often require detailed assumptions
  and careful specification of hyperparameters. Such model complexity issues
  only compound when trying to generalize generative models to incorporate
  human input. We introduce Correlation Explanation ({CorEx}), an alternative
  approach to topic modeling that does not assume an underlying generative
  model, and instead learns maximally informative topics through an
  information-theoretic framework. This framework naturally generalizes to
  hierarchical and semi-supervised extensions with no additional modeling
  assumptions. In particular, word-level domain knowledge can be flexibly
  incorporated within {CorEx} through anchor words, allowing topic separability
  and representation to be promoted with minimal human intervention. Across a
  variety of datasets, metrics, and experiments, we demonstrate that {CorEx}
  produces topics that are comparable in quality to those produced by
  unsupervised and semi-supervised variants of {LDA}.%

    With The Old Regime and the Revolution, Alexis de Tocqueville wrote what
  remains the essential history of the French Revolution. Yet historians have
  found it nearly impossible to trace the evolution of Tocqueville's ideas
  because he chose not to disclose his sources. Drawing on his unprecedented
  access to Tocqueville's papers—access made possible by the late French
  historian Francois Furet—Robert T. Gannett Jr. reveals the ingenuity of
  Tocqueville's analyses of issues such as landownership, administrative
  centralization, and public opinion in prerevolutionary France. He also sheds
  light on the benefits Tocqueville reaped from unexpected intellectual
  encounters with such authors as Burke, Constant, and Dareste de la Chavanne.
  A literary detective at work, Gannett tracks Tocqueville as the author
  himself tracked the French Revolution—and brings him to life as a
  meticulous historian and an ardent defender of liberty. An ideal companion to
  The Old Regime and the Revolution, Volumes 1 and 2, both published by the
  University of Chicago Press, Tocqueville Unveiled will be a valuable resource
  for revolutionary historians and Tocqueville enthusiasts alike.%

    The normative concepts offer a principled basis for engineering flexible
  multiagent systems for business and other cross-organizational settings.
  However, producing suitable specifications is nontrivial: the difficulty is
  an obstacle to the adoption of multiagent systems in industry. This paper
  considers normative relationships of six main types, namely, commitments
  (both practical and dialectical), authorizations, powers, prohibitions, and
  sanctions. It applies natural language processing and machine learning to
  extract these relationships from business contracts, establishing that they
  are realistic and their encoding can assist modelers, thereby lowering a
  barrier to adoption. A ten-fold cross-validation over more than 800 sentences
  randomly drawn from a corpus of real-life contracts (and manually labeled)
  yields promising results for the viability of this approach.%

    In fine art, especially painting, humans have mastered the skill to create
  unique visual experiences through composing a complex interplay between the
  content and style of an image. Thus far the algorithmic basis of this process
  is unknown and there exists no artificial system with similar capabilities.
  However, in other key areas of visual perception such as object and face
  recognition near-human performance was recently demonstrated by a class of
  biologically inspired vision models called Deep Neural Networks. Here we
  introduce an artificial system based on a Deep Neural Network that creates
  artistic images of high perceptual quality. The system uses neural
  representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary
  images, providing a neural algorithm for the creation of artistic images.
  Moreover, in light of the striking similarities between performance-optimised
  artificial neural networks and biological vision, our work offers a path
  forward to an algorithmic understanding of how humans create and perceive
  artistic imagery.%

    Assessing scholarly influence is critical for understanding the collective
  system of scholarship and the history of academic inquiry. Influence is
  multifaceted, and citations reveal only part of it. Citation counts exhibit
  preferential attachment and follow a rigid “news cycle” that can miss
  sustained and indirect forms of influence. Building on dynamic topic models
  that track distributional shifts in discourse over time, we introduce a
  variant that incorporates features, such as authorship, affiliation, and
  publication venue, to assess how these contexts interact with content to
  shape future scholarship. We perform in-depth analyses on collections of
  physics research (500,000 abstracts; 102 years) and scholarship generally
  ({JSTOR} repository: 2 million full-text articles; 130 years). Our measure of
  document influence helps predict citations and shows how outcomes, such as
  winning a Nobel Prize or affiliation with a highly ranked institution, boost
  influence. Analysis of citations alongside discursive influence reveals that
  citations tend to credit authors who persist in their fields over time and
  discount credit for works that are influential over many topics or are
  “ahead of their time.” In this way, our measures provide a way to
  acknowledge diverse contributions that take longer and travel farther to
  achieve scholarly appreciation, enabling us to correct citation biases and
  enhance sensitivity to the full spectrum of scholarly impact.%

    The study of strategic action (game theory) is moving from a formal science
  of rational behavior to an evolutionary tool kit for studying behavior in a
  broad array of social settings. In this problem-oriented introduction to the
  field, Herbert Gintis exposes students to the techniques and applications of
  game theory through a wealth of sophisticated and surprisingly fun-to-solve
  problems involving human (and even animal) behavior. Game Theory Evolving is
  innovative in several ways. First, it reflects game theory's expansion into
  such areas as cooperation in teams, networks, the evolution and diffusion of
  preferences, the connection between biology and economics, artificial life
  simulations, and experimental economics. Second, the book--recognizing that
  students learn by doing and that most game theory texts are weak on
  problems--is organized around problems, and introduces principles through
  practice. Finally, the quality of the problems is simply unsurpassed, and
  each chapter provides a study plan for instructors interested in teaching
  evolutionary game theory. Reflecting the growing consensus that in many
  important contexts outside of anonymous markets, human behavior is not well
  described by classical "rationality," Gintis shows students how to apply game
  theory to model how people behave in ways that reflect the special nature of
  human sociality and individuality. This book is perfect for upper
  undergraduate and graduate economics courses as well as a terrific
  introduction for ambitious do-it-yourselfers throughout the behavioral
  sciences.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the first major reinterpretation of the French Enlightenment in twenty
  years, Dena Goodman moves beyond the traditional approach to the
  Enlightenment as a chapter in Western intellectual history and examines its
  deeper significance as cultural history. She finds the very epicenter of the
  Enlightenment in a community of discourse known as the Republic of Letters,
  where salons governed by women advanced the Enlightenment project "to change
  the common way of thinking." Goodman details the history of the Republic of
  Letters in the Parisian salons, where men and women, philosophes and
  salonnieres, together not only introduced reciprocity into intellectual life
  through the practices of letter writing and polite conversation but also
  developed a republican model of government that was to challenge the
  monarchy. Providing a new understanding of women's importance in the
  Enlightenment, Goodman demonstrates that in the Republic of Letters men and
  women played complementary - and unequal - roles. Salonnieres governed the
  Republic of Letters by enforcing rules of polite conversation that made
  possible a discourse characterized by liberty and civility. Goodman
  chronicles the story of the Republic of Letters from its earliest formation
  through major periods of change: the production of the Encyclopedia, the
  proliferation of a print culture that widened circles of readership beyond
  the control of salon governance, and the early years of the French
  Revolution. Although the legacy of the Republic of Letters remained a force
  in French cultural and political life, in the 1780s men formed new
  intellectual institutions that asserted their ability to govern themselves
  and that marginalized women. {TheRepublic} of Letters introduces provocative
  explanations both for the failure of the Enlightenment and for the role of
  the Enlightenment in the French Revolution.%

    This book reconstructs how a group of nineteenth-century labor reformers
  appropriated and radicalized the republican tradition. These "labor
  republicans" derived their definition of freedom from a long tradition of
  political theory dating back to the classical republics. In this tradition,
  to be free is to be independent of anyone else's will - to be dependent is to
  be a slave. Borrowing these ideas, labor republicans argued that wage
  laborers were unfree because of their abject dependence on their employers.
  Workers in a cooperative, on the other hand, were considered free because
  they equally and collectively controlled their work. Although these labor
  republicans are relatively unknown, this book details their unique,
  contemporary, and valuable perspective on both American history and the
  organization of the economy.%

    Political scientists lack methods to efficiently measure the priorities
  political actors emphasize in statements. To address this limitation, I
  introduce a statistical model that attends to the structure of political
  rhetoric when measuring expressed priorities: statements are naturally
  organized by author. The expressed agenda model exploits this structure to
  simultaneously estimate the topics in the texts, as well as the attention
  political actors allocate to the estimated topics. I apply the method to a
  collection of over 24,000 press releases from senators from 2007, which I
  demonstrate is an ideal medium to measure how senators explain their work in
  Washington to constituents. A set of examples validates the estimated
  priorities and demonstrates their usefulness for testing theories of how
  members of Congress communicate with constituents. The statistical model and
  its extensions will be made available in a forthcoming free software package
  for the R computing language.%

    Politics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word.
  Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even
  moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political
  science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it
  substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We
  provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many
  instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there
  are pitfalls to using automated methods–they are no substitute for careful
  thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific
  validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to
  validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in
  the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to
  become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must
  contribute new methods and new methods of validation.%

    Since the latest crisis of capitalism broke out in 2008, Marx has been back
  in fashion, and sometimes it seems that his ideas have never been as topical,
  or as commanding of respect and interest, as they are today. This edited
  collection arises from one of the largest international conferences dedicated
  to the bicentenary of Marx’s birth. The volume contains 16 chapters
  authored by globally renowned scholars and is divided into two parts: I) On
  the Critique of Politics; {II}) On the Critique of Political Economy. These
  contributions, from multiple academic disciplines, offer diverse perspectives
  on why Marx is still so relevant for our times and make this book a source of
  great appeal for both expert scholars of Marx as well as students and general
  readers who are approaching his theories for the first time.%

  violence across the world. Forty years later, serious conflicts continue in
  Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Ted Robert Gurr reintroduces us to his
  landmark work, putting it in context with the research it influenced as well

    The radical geographer guides us through the classic text of political
  economy. "My aim is to get you to read a book by Karl Marx called Capital,
  Volume 1, and to read it on Marx's own terms..." The biggest financial crisis
  since the Great Depression has generated a surge of interest in Marx's work
  in the effort to understand the origins of our current predicament. For
  nearly forty years, David Harvey has written and lectured on Capital,
  becoming one of the world's most foremost Marx scholars. Based on his recent
  lectures, this current volume aims to bring this depth of learning to a
  broader audience, guiding first-time readers through a fascinating and deeply
  rewarding text. A Companion to Marx's Capital offers fresh, original and
  sometimes critical interpretations of a book that changed the course of
  history and, as Harvey intimates, may do so again.%

    In Marx, Capital, and the Madness of Economic Reason, David
  Harvey-Capital's greatest expositor-explains one of the most important
  political and economic texts of the nineteenth century in readily
  understandable terms.Karl Marx's Capital is one of the most important texts
  written in the modern era. Since 1867, when the first of its three volumes
  was published, it has had a profound effect on politics and economics in
  theory and practice throughout the world. But Marx wrote in the context of
  capitalism in thesecond half of the nineteenth century: his assumptions and
  analysis need to be updated in order to address to the technological,
  economic, and industrial change that has followed Capital's initial
  publication.In Marx, Capital, and the Madness of Economic Reason, David
  Harvey not only provides a concise distillation of his famous course on
  Capital, but also makes the text relevant to the twenty-first century's
  continued processes of globalization. Harvey shows the work's continuing
  analytical power, doingso in the clearest and simplest terms but never
  compromising its depth and complexity.Marx, Capital, and the Madness of
  Economic Reason provides an accessible window into Harvey's unique approach
  to Marxism and takes readers on a riveting roller coaster ride through recent
  global history. It demonstrates how and why Capital remains a living,
  breathing document with an outsizedinfluence on contemporary social thought.%

    The global economic crisis and recession that began in 2008 had at least
  one unexpected outcome: a surge in sales of Karl Marx's Capital. Although
  mainstream economists and commentators once dismissed Marx's work as outmoded
  and flawed, some are begrudgingly acknowledging an analysis that sees
  capitalism as inherently unstable. And of course, there are those, like
  Michael Heinrich, who have seen the value of Marx all along, and are in a
  unique position to explain the intricacies of Marx's thought.Heinrich's
  modern interpretation of Capital is now available to English-speaking readers
  for the first time. It has gone through nine editions in Germany, is the
  standard work for Marxist study groups, and is used widely in German
  universities. The author systematically covers all three volumes of Capital
  and explains all the basic aspects of Marx's critique of capitalism in a way
  that is clear and concise. He provides background information on the
  intellectual and political milieu in which Marx worked, and looks at crucial
  issues beyond the scope of Capital, such as class struggle, the relationship
  between capital and the state, accusations of historical determinism, and
  Marx's understanding of communism. Uniquely, Heinrich emphasizes the monetary
  character of Marx's work, in addition to the traditional emphasis on the
  labor theory of value, this highlighting the relevance of Capital to the age
  of financial explosions and implosions.%

    For over a century, Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism has been a crucial
  resource for social movements. Now, recent economic crises have made it
  imperative for us to comprehend and actualize Marx’s ideas. But without a
  knowledge of Karl Marx’s life as he lived it, neither Marx nor his works
  can be fully understood. There are more than twenty-five comprehensive
  biographies of Marx, but none of them consider his life and work in equal,
  corresponding measure. This biography, planned for three volumes, aims to
  include what most biographies have reduced to mere background: the
  contemporary conflicts, struggles, and disputes that engaged Marx at the time
  of his writings, alongside his complex relationships with a varied assortment
  of friends and opponents. This first volume will deal extensively with
  Marx’s youth in Trier and his studies in Bonn and Berlin. It will also
  examine the function of poetry in his intellectual development and his first
  occupation with Hegelian philosophy and with the so-called “young
  Hegelians” in his 1841 Dissertation. Already during this period, there were
  crises as well as breaks in Marx’s intellectual development that prompted
  Marx to give up projects and re-conceptualize his critical enterprise. This
  volume is the beginning of an astoundingly dimensional look at Karl Marx –
  a study of a complex life and body of work through the neglected issues,
  events, and people that helped comprise both. It is destined to become a
  classic.%

    {THE} {AGE} {OF} {EMPIRE} is a book about the strange death of the
  nineteenth century, the world made by and for liberal middle classes in the
  name of universal progress and civilisation. It is about hopes realised which
  turned into fears: an era of unparalleled peace engendering an era of
  unparalleled war; revolt and revolution emerging on the outskirts of society;
  a time of profound identity crisis for bourgeois classes, among new and
  sudden mass labour movements which rejected capitalism and new middle classes
  which rejected liberalism. It is about world empires built and held with
  almost contemptuous ease by small bodies of Europeans which were to last
  barely a human lifetime, and a European domination of world history, which
  was never more confident than at the moment it was about to disappear for
  ever. It is about Queen Victoria, Madame Curie and the Kodak Girl, and the
  novel social world of cloth caps, golf clubs and brassieres, about Nietzsche,
  Carnegie, William Morris and Dreyfus, about politically ineffective
  terrorists, one of whom, to his and everyone's surprise, started a world
  war.With the {AGE} {OF} {EMPIRE}, Eric Hobsbawm, Britain's leading historian
  of the left, brings to a dazzling climax his brilliant interpretative history
  of 'the long nineteenth century'.%

    The first and best, major treatment of the crucial years 1848-1875, a
  penetrating analysis of the rise of capitalism throught the world.In the
  1860s a new word entered the economic and political vocabulary of the world:
  'capitalism'. The global triumph of capitalism is the major theme of history
  in the decades after 1848. It was the triumph of a society which believed
  that economic growth rests on competitive private enterprise, on success in
  buying everything in the cheapest market (including labour) and selling it in
  the dearest. An economy so based, and therefore nestling naturally on the
  sound foundations of a bourgoisie composed of those whom energy, merit and
  intelligence had raised to their position and kept there, would - it was
  believed - not only create a world of suitably distributed material plenty
  but of ever-growing enlightenment, reason and human opportunity, an advance
  of the sciences and the arts, in brief a world of continuous and accelerating
  material and moral progress.%

    Beginning as a philosopher, Marx turned in the space of a few short years
  to the study of political economy and to revolutionary practice. Howard
  argues that this shift can be understood only in terms of an analysis of the
  theoretical development of the Marxian dialectic. In explicating the
  systematic aspects of Marx’s theory, Howard has gone anew to the primary
  sources, the writings of Marx himself and those of Hegel and the Young
  Hegelians. Howard thus provides a close textual study of Marx’s developing
  theory and method as it emerges in his confrontation with the Hegelian
  dialectic. This systematic study is more than a commentary insofar as it
  con­centrates on the development of a critical theory, dialectically
  founded, whose implications affect our perception of contemporary problems
  and our ability to affect social change today. The interpretation is not
  orthodox, and is intended to spur both students and teachers to a rethinking
  of both theory and practice.%

    In this book, Marc Morjé Howard addresses immigrant integration, one of
  the most critical challenges facing European countries today, the resolution
  of which will in large part depend on how foreigners can become citizens.
  Howard's research shows that despite remarkable convergence in their
  economic, judicial, and social policies, the countries of the European Union
  still maintain very different definitions of citizenship. Based on an
  innovative measure of national citizenship policies, the book accounts for
  both historical variation and contemporary change. Howard's historical
  explanation highlights the legacies of colonialism and early democratization,
  which unintentionally created relatively inclusive citizenship regimes. The
  contemporary analysis explores why some of the more restrictive countries
  have liberalized in recent decades, whereas others have not. Howard's
  argument focuses on the politics of citizenship, showing in particular how
  anti-immigrant public opinion - when activated politically, usually by far
  right movements or public referenda - can block the liberalizing tendencies
  of political elites. Overall, the book shows the far-reaching implications of
  this growing and volatile issue.%

  the creation of ‘Military Marxist Regimes in Africa’, and on their demise
  and the wider collapse of Marxist governments on the continent. This volume,
  first published in 1992, derives from a roundtable on the theme of ‘The
  Retreat from Moscow: African and Eastern European Experiences of
  Disengagement from Marxism’, held at the University of Birmingham in
  September 1991. The conference examined the recent experiences of African
  countries in transition from Marxism and Marxist-influenced ideologies to an
  uncertain future based on the market economy and a plural political system.%

    "Written with brio, warmth, and historical understanding, this is the best
  biography of one of the most attractive inhabitants of Victorian England,
  Marx's friend, partner, and political heir."—Eric {HobsbawmFriedrich}
  Engels is one of the most intriguing and contradictory figures of the
  nineteenth century. Born to a prosperous mercantile family, he spent his life
  enjoying the comfortable existence of a Victorian gentleman; yet he was at
  the same time the co-author of The Communist Manifesto, a ruthless political
  tactician, and the man who sacrificed his best years so that Karl Marx could
  have the freedom to write. Although his contributions are frequently
  overlooked, Engels's grasp of global capital provided an indispensable
  foundation for communist doctrine, and his account of the Industrial
  Revolution, The Condition of the Working Class in England, remains one of the
  most haunting and brutal indictments of capitalism's human cost.Drawing on a
  wealth of letters and archives, acclaimed historian Tristram Hunt plumbs
  Engels's intellectual legacy and shows us how one of the great bon viveurs of
  Victorian Britain reconciled his exuberant personal life with his radical
  political philosophy. This epic story of devoted friendship, class
  compromise, ideological struggle, and family betrayal at last brings Engels
  out from the shadow of his famous friend and collaborator.%

    This paper examines the dynamics of violence in the Palestinian-Israeli
  conflict during the Second Intifada. Using data on the daily number of
  fatalities between September 2000 and January 2005, we estimate reaction
  functions for both Israelis and Palestinians and find evidence of Granger
  causality from Palestinian to Israeli violence, but not vice versa. This
  finding is consistent using either the incidence or level of fatalities and
  is robust to the specification of the lag structure and the level of time
  aggregation. We find no evidence that the Palestinians and Israelis are
  engaged in a predictable "tit-for-tat" cycle of violence. ({JEL} D74, H56,

    \field{abstract}{%
    By the start of the Victorian period the school of British economists
  acknowledging Adam Smith as its master was in the ascendancy. 'Political
  Economy', a catch-all title which ignored the diversity of viewpoints to be
  found amongst the discipline's leading proponents, became associated in the
  popular mind with moral and political forces held to be uniquely conducive to
  the progress of an increasingly industrialised and competitive society.
  'Political Economy' served in turn as the focus for critics of equally
  diverse moral and political persuasions, who sought to challenge the
  materialism of contemporary society and offer their own assessments of the
  profound social changes of the time. In the introductory essay to the
  collection of readings from such 'critics of capitalism', the editors review
  the principles of the early economists, the way in which these principles
  were appropriated and applied by their Victorian successors and the
  contrasting modes which critics of popular economic ideas assumed. Subsequent
  extracts from the writings of the Owenite Socialist John Bray, Carlyle, Marx
  and Engels, J. S. Mill, Ruskin, Arnold, T. H. Green, William Morris and G. B.
  Shaw, demonstrate both the breadth of the possible grounds for ideological
  opposition to the prevailing philosophy and the shifting nature of the debate
  as 'Political Economy' itself was revealed as incapable of explaining or
  responding to the changing conditions of the 1870s. Headnotes to the extracts
  describe the genesis of individual debate and discuss distinctive stylistic
  features. Annotation in the form of footnotes and endnotes has been designed
  to gloss obscure allusions and arguments. In making more accessible the
  socio-economic writings of those authors now better known for their
  imaginative work, this volume will enable readers to reach a more profound
  appreciation of the central role such work played in developing the moral
  vision embodied in their more lastingly popular books and essays.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This article reexamines Marx's early conception of history by returning to
  his 1845–6 manuscripts, long known as The German Ideology. On conventional
  interpretations of these manuscripts, Marx sought to explain the entire
  historical process through a theory of the systematic development of
  productive forces. This article reveals that concern to be an artifact of
  subsequent editorial practices and argues that a different concern animated
  the manuscripts for Marx himself—namely to grasp the nature of individual
  epochs, particularly the present one, which he doubted that a generalized
  theory of history could help him to do. In “Saint Max,” perhaps the most
  neglected of these early manuscripts, Marx developed the concept of a “mode
  of production” into a historical lens, one that could aid the work of
  social critique by bringing into focus how the present is made and might be
  made anew.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The Ethical Foundations of Marxism, first published in 1962 and corrected
  and revised for a 1972 edition, examines carefully and critically the origin,
  precise nature and subsequent role of Marx’s ethical beliefs. Drawing
  freely on Marx’s still largely untranslated philosophical works and drafts
  the author elicits the ethical presuppositions with which Marx began. He then
  examines the intellectual development that made Marx a Communist and seeks to
  clarify the place of Marx’s ethic in his mature, ‘materialist’ work.
  Professor Kamenka distinguishes sharply between the critical, ethical views
  of Marx and the inept, conventional applications of his doctrine by Engels.
  He appraises the ‘ethics’ of the Communist Party and traces the
  development of the moral and legal theory in the Soviet Union. He concludes
  by subjecting Marxism as a whole to a radical, ethical and philosophical
  criticism for which Marx himself laid some of the foundations.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In 1980 Alvin Gouldner identified two traditions of Marxist
  thought--Marxism as science and Marxism as critique. This book is concerned
  with the first and by far the most politically influential of those
  traditions--Marxism as science. It analyzes the claim, first made by Marx and
  Engels themselves, that Marxism is some kind of hard natural science of
  society able to identify laws of social development and to provide a
  scientific guide to revolutionary activity. Marxism and Science breaks new
  ground by using Wittgensteinian analysis of Marxist discourse to construct a
  totally different conception of Marxism appropriate to the postmodern world.
  In this conception, Marxism is a point of view that can be advanced,
  rationally defended, and made convincing and persuasive to others, but that
  is as partial in some respects as any other political point of view.
  Reconceiving Marxism thus requires not only understanding language in a
  different nonobjectivist way but also adopting a new political practice and
  program, which the book proceeds to outline. Marxism and Science concludes
  that, intellectually, Marxism as hard science is fairly obviously and
  profoundly untenable. But it goes on to argue that the purely intellectual
  grounds for this claim are much less interesting than the political and
  psychological purposes that such a claim has always served for Marxists in
  particular and scientific socialists in general. The most important of these
  purposes has been to provide a sort of psychological and emotional certitude
  to set against the overwhelming existential domination of capitalism in the
  world. Claiming this certitude to be as spurious as the arguments used to
  sustain it, the author calls upon Marxists and socialists to admit this and
  accept the doubt and uncertainty that come with a frank avowal of an open and
  unforeclosed future.%

    Political parties are often assumed to be adaptive, strategic organisations
  that continuously alter their policy positions to maximise electoral support.
  However, ideological continuity is an integral part of democratic
  representation as well. How do parties balance these seemingly conflicting
  roles? This study combines insights from spatial models of elections and
  cleavage theory to explain stability and change in European party positions.
  Embracing the multidimensionality of the policy space, I argue that a
  party’s reputation and durable party-voter linkages constrain positional
  change on its more salient, primary dimension. Yet, by remaining
  ideologically true to its supporters’ key concerns, a party can
  strategically shift on secondary issues outside of its core agenda.
  Cross-sectional time series analysis of party positions (1999–2019) across
  fourteen Western European countries confirms this prediction, especially for
  small to medium-sized and opposition parties. This finding has important
  implications for our understanding of party strategy and democratic
  representation.Supplemental data for this article can be accessed online at:

    We argue word embedding models are a useful tool for the study of culture
  using a historical analysis of shared understandings of social class as an
  empirical case. Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as
  relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a
  relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture.
  Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces
  correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words
  onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate
  with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years,
  we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic
  transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions
  of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education,
  which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with
  cultivated taste.%

    We propose a new computational approach for tracking and detecting
  statistically significant linguistic shifts in the meaning and usage of
  words. Such linguistic shifts are especially prevalent on the Internet, where
  the rapid exchange of ideas can quickly change a word's meaning. Our
  meta-analysis approach constructs property time series of word usage, and
  then uses statistically sound change point detection algorithms to identify
  significant linguistic shifts. We consider and analyze three approaches of
  increasing complexity to generate such linguistic property time series, the
  culmination of which uses distributional characteristics inferred from word
  co-occurrences. Using recently proposed deep neural language models, we first
  train vector representations of words for each time period. Second, we warp
  the vector spaces into one unified coordinate system. Finally, we construct a
  distance-based distributional time series for each word to track its
  linguistic displacement over time. We demonstrate that our approach is
  scalable by tracking linguistic change across years of micro-blogging using
  Twitter, a decade of product reviews using a corpus of movie reviews from
  Amazon, and a century of written books using the Google Book Ngrams. Our
  analysis reveals interesting patterns of language usage change commensurate
  with each medium.%

    The great French Marxist philosopher weighs up the contributions of the
  three major critics of {modernityWith} the translation of Lefebvre's
  philosophical writings, his stature in the English-speaking world continues
  to grow. Though certainly within the Marxist tradition, he consistently saw
  Marx as an 'unavoidable, necessary, but insufficient starting point'.
  Unsurprisingly, Lefebvre always insisted on the importance of Hegel to
  understanding Marx. But the imposing Metaphilosophy also suggested the
  significance he ascribed to Nietzsche, in the 'realm of shadows' through
  which philosophy seeks to think the world. Lefebvre proposes here that the
  modern world is at the same time Hegelian in terms of the state; Marxist in
  terms of the social and society; and Nietzschean in terms of civilization and
  its values. As early as 1939, Lefebvre pioneered a French reading of
  Nietzsche that rejected the philosopher's appropriation by fascism, bringing
  out the tragic implications of Nietzsche's proclamation that 'God is dead'
  long before this approach was followed by such later writers as Foucault,
  Derrida and Deleuze. Forty years later, in the last of his philosophical
  writings, Lefebvre juxtaposes the contributions of the three great thinkers,
  in a text whose themes remain surprisingly relevant today.%

  universal suffrage. These commitments led him to reject absolute and

  disillusionment with the ability of a modern republic to deliver human

  that the republic would be a bourgeois republic, which would subject the
  proletariat to the capitalist. He attacked republicans for neglecting social
  depredation in favour of political reform. However, his transition to
  communism also carried with it several republican commitments. Unlike the
  many apolitical versions of communism at the time, Marx insisted that the
  workers had to establish the republic before communism could emerge. He also
  extended key republican political ideas, including the objection to arbitrary
  power, to the social sphere. But what was absent was an account of a more
  participatory and accountable political alternative to the modern
  republic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}However, the
  experience of ordinary workers carrying out the legislative and public
  administration of Paris during the Commune, led Marx to return to many of
  those early republican themes. He celebrated ordinary citizens' capacity for
  self-government and advocated popular control over the state and transforming
  representative democracy into popular delegacy. He came to realise that these
  political structures were essential to achieving the social goals of
  communism. He thus came to a synthesis of his early republicanism and later
  communism.%

    Republicanism is a powerful resource for emancipatory struggles against
  domination. Its commitment to popular sovereignty subverts justifications of
  authority, locating power in the hands of the citizenry who hold the capacity
  to create, transform, and maintain their political institutions.
  Republicanism's conception of freedom rejects social, political, and economic
  structures subordinating citizens to any uncontrolled power - from capitalism
  and wage-labour to patriarchy and imperialism. It views any such domination
  as inimical to republican freedom. Moreover, it combines a revolutionary
  commitment to overturning despotic and tyrannical regimes with the creation
  of political and economic institutions that realise the sovereignty of all
  citizens, institutions that are resilient to threats of oligarchical control.
  This volume is dedicated to retrieving and developing this radical potential,
  challenging the more conventional moderate conceptions of republicanism. It
  brings together scholars at the forefront of tracing this radical heritage of
  the republican tradition, and developing arguments, texts, and practices into
  a critical and emancipatory body of political and social thought. The volume
  spans historical discussions of the English Levellers, French and Ottoman
  revolutionaries, and American abolitionists and trade unionists; explorations
  of the radical republican aspects of the thought of Machiavelli, Marx, and
  Rousseau; and theoretical examinations of social domination and popular
  constitutionalism. It will appeal to political theorists, historians of
  political thought, and political activists interested in how republicanism
  provides a robust and successful radical transformation to existing social
  and political orders.%

    The Young Karl Marx is an innovative and important study of Marx's early
  writings. These writings provide the fascinating spectacle of a powerful and
  imaginative intellect wrestling with complex and significant issues, but they
  also present formidable interpretative obstacles to modern readers. David
  Leopold shows how an understanding of their intellectual and cultural context
  can illuminate the political dimension of these works. An erudite yet
  accessible discussion of Marx's influences and targets frames the author's
  critical engagement with Marx's account of the emergence, character, and
  (future) replacement of the modern state. This combination of historical and
  analytical approaches results in a sympathetic, but not uncritical,
  exploration of such fundamental themes as alienation, citizenship, community,
  anti-semitism, and utopianism. The Young Karl Marx is a scholarly and
  original work which provides a radical and persuasive reinterpretation of
  Marx's complex and often misunderstood views of German philosophy, modern
  politics, and human flourishing.%

    Divergent Paths is the first volume of a groundbreaking three-volume work.
  Its purpose is to explore the relationship between Hegel and Marx; to define
  the relationship between Hegel and Engels; and to distinguish between the
  theories of Marxism and Engelsism. Marx used Feuerbach towards the critique
  and ultimate transformation of Hegel's phenomenology and humanism. This
  transformation, which cut out Hegel's idealism by identifying the environment
  in which people produced their sustenance as the subject of history, marks
  the genesis of historical materialism. Marx continued to use Hegel's logical
  categories. In chapter three of Divergent Paths, Norman Levine conducts an in
  depth study of Marx's 1841 doctoral dissertation, The Difference Between
  Democritus' and Epicurus' Philosophy of Nature. It is the center of gravity
  and controversy of Levine's study. Placed alongside Hegel's Philosophy of
  History, Levine isolates the categories Marx appropriated from Hegel to show,
  conclusively, that Marx was not a dialectical materialist. Levine then claims
  that Engels totally distorted the Hegelian legacy, and this debasement is
  enshrined in his 1887 essay 'Ludwig Feuerbach and The End of Classical German
  Philosophy.' Levine brilliantly locates Marxism as the theory of Marx, and
  Engelsism the theory of Engels. According to Levine both embodied a separate
  view of history and society, and their contradictions are expressive, in
  part, of their divergent receptions of Hegel. This is an analysis like no
  other published to date with two more volumes planned. Philosophers,
  sociologists, anthropologists and historiographers of Marx and Engels cannot
  afford to miss this study.%

    "This book seeks to show how Karl Marx's vision of communism was a
  continuation of Aristotle's classical humanist philosophy. Challenging the
  Engelsian distortion of Marx, it presents a negation of previous
  interpretations of Marx which present him in materialist terms. Engels
  proposed a picture of the highest stage of communist society as an economic
  egalitarianism, a vision which became an axiom of Leninist-Stalinist-Soviet
  Communism. By contrast, here it is shown that Marx embraced the Aristotelian
  concept of "distributive justice", of proportionate equality. Spanning the
  works of Marx, from his university education and doctoral dissertation on the
  differences between the Democritean and Epicurean philosophy of the atom, to
  the study of his Rheinische Zeitung period and the persistence of classical
  humanism in Marx's defense of the freedom of the press, Levine skillfully
  reveals the gravitational pull between Marx and Aristotle. Showing how
  classical humanism is the dominant ethos in the communism of Marx, the book
  includes chapters on: Hegel as a transition point between Aristotle and Marx;
  The links between Marx's theory of labor and Aristotle's idea of the
  constitutive subject located in The Politics; How the local methodologies of
  Aristotle and Hegel provided Marx with the social methodologies by which to
  interpret the functioning of capitalism. Marx's Resurrection of Aristotle is
  the culmination of Norman Levine's life-long work to establish the correct
  placement of Marx and Marx's communism within the classical humanist
  tradition"--%

    In the late eighteen-seventies, the German Social Democratic Party, while
  still healing the wounds of old battles between Lassalleans and Eisenachers,
  was confronted by foes who delivered attacks on two levels. On the one level,
  Bismarck and his supporters fought energetically to annihilate the party with
  the passage of the Socialist Law (October 21, 1878). After some initial
  faltering steps, the Social Democrats found a firm footing and struggled
  successfully to preserve their political existence. The movement was
  preserved, even though the party organization, its affiliates and its
  newspapers were suppressed. On another level, the Social Democrats faced an
  ideological challenge. Their political suppression broadly paralleled the
  emergence of a conservative socialism which flourished for a short time in a
  variety of forms. Whatever clothing it wore, conservative socialism aimed to
  undermine the growing appeal of Social Democracy to the working-men of
  Germany. A theory of State Socialism was the most attractive garment designed
  by conservative social thought. The response of the Social Democratic Party
  to the various facets of this conservative socialism is a significant chapter
  in the history of the German socialist movement.%

    The globalised world of the twenty-first century has many parallels with
  that of the period running up to the cataclysm of 1914, namely the world
  predicted by Karl Marx. Communications go that much faster, but this is a
  difference of degree, not type. People, messages, and ideas are flung around
  the globe. Money circulates in a never-ceasing torrent, poverty lives side by
  side with wealth, and capital exercises its impersonal power over each and
  every one of us. In this world, Karl Marx blunt and straightforward enough to
  inspire criticism of the latest exploits of capitalism, the failings of
  politics, and the genuflection of those in power before fetishes like The
  Market ' lives on. Despite nearly 200 years having passed since his birth,
  his burning condemnation of capitalism remains of immediate interest today.
  The texts he left behind gave rise to what would come to be called Marxism,
  but that was a term he rejected. His approach enormous amounts of reading and
  writing, integrating new discoveries from the various sciences into his
  analyses of society was a far cry from how his theories would come to be used
  in states where only one, party-approved interpretation was allowed. Now,
  more than ever before, these texts can be read for what they truly are. In
  addition to providing a living picture of Marx the man, his life, and his
  family and friends as well as his lifelong collaboration with Friedrich
  Engels Sweden 's leading intellectual historian Sven-Eric Liedman, in this

  exert a powerful attraction for the inhabitants of the twenty-first.%

    Lenin's "What is to Be Done?" (1902) has long been seen as the founding
  document of a 'party of a new type'. For some, it provided a model of
  'vanguard party' that was the essence of Bolshevism, for others it manifested
  Lenin's elitist and manipulatory attitude towards the workers. This
  substantial new commentary, based on contemporary Russian- and
  German-language sources, provides hitherto unavailable contextual information
  that undermines these views and shows how Lenin's argument rests squarely on
  an optimistic confidence in the workers' revolutionary inclinations and on
  his admiration of German Social Democracy in particular. Lenin's outlook
  cannot be understood, Lih claims here, outside the context of international
  Social Democracy, the disputes within Russian Social Democracy and the
  institutions of the revolutionary underground. The new translation focuses
  attention on hard-to-translate key terms. This study raises new and
  unsettling questions about the legacy of Marx, Bolshevism as a historical
  force, and the course of Soviet history, but, most of all, it will
  revolutionise the conventional interpretations of Lenin. About "Bread and
  Authority (1990)" (by Lars T. Lih) '"If we could put the desperately ill
  Russia of today on the psyciatrist's couch, we would inevitably have to spend

    After Karl Marx, Vladimir Lenin (1870–1924) is the man most associated
  with communism and its influence and reach around the world. Lenin was the
  leader of the communist Bolshevik party during the October 1917 revolution in
  Russia, and he subsequently headed the Soviet state until 1924, bringing
  stability to the region and establishing a socialist economic and political
  system. In Lenin, Lars T. Lih presents a striking new interpretation of
  Lenin’s political beliefs and strategies. Until now, Lenin has been
  portrayed as a pessimist with a dismissive view of the revolutionary
  potential of the workers. However, Lih reveals that underneath the sharp
  polemics, Lenin was actually a romantic enthusiast rather than a sour
  pragmatist, one who imposed meaning on the whirlwind of events going on
  around him. This concise and unique biography is based on wide-ranging new
  research that puts Lenin into the context both of Russian society and of the
  international socialist movement of the early twentieth century. It also sets
  the development of Lenin’s political outlook firmly within the framework of
  his family background and private life. In addition, the book’s images,
  which are taken from contemporary photographs, posters, and drawings,
  illustrate the features of Lenin’s world and time. A vivid, non-ideological
  portrait, Lenin is an essential look at one of the key figures of modern
  history.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Recent work on the history of political thought, exploiting digital
  resources, is challenging the idea that empirically and hermeneutically
  minded political scientists must work independently in silos. Work by
  students of the Cambridge School and work by textual data miners are showing
  the way toward a new hermeneutical circle—one in which empirically and
  hermeneutically minded political scientists can use digital resources to
  analyze diverse texts and make groundbreaking discoveries on relationships
  between textual uses of language and political change. I analyze this new
  trend toward different sorts of political scientists using digital resources
  to study ideas, to outline underlying paradigms relating language and
  politics in these respective fields, and to consider how they could be
  brought into productive conversation. I then consider how such conversation
  would enrich subdisciplinary understandings of the role of language in
  politics. Ultimately, I use this analysis to generate a broader model for how
  empirically and hermeneutically inclined political scientists can benefit
  from collaboration in the age of digital humanities.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    One reader has called this study, first published in 1984, ‘easily the
  best book on the relation of Hegel to Marx’. With spirited argument,
  {MacGregor} demonstrates that Hegelian logic suited Marx’s purpose so well
  because it already contained the unique elements that later appeared in
  Marx’s social theory, including the notions of surplus value and the
  transition to communism. The most exciting thing about the book is the clear
  demonstration that the mature Marx gets ever closer to Hegel, and is
  increasingly indebted to him. In short, the author gives us a new Hegel and a
  new Marx. In a manner both original and penetrating, {MacGregor} shows that
  dialectical logic is pre-eminently social logic, a reconstruction in thought
  of social relationships and social structure. Central to the work is the
  examination of the Philosophy of Right, in which Hegel delineated a theory of
  modern capitalist society. {MacGregor} provides a compelling analysis of
  Hegel’s importance for Lenin and a strong caveat that contemporary Marxism
  ignores Hegel to its own peril. {MacGregor} establishes that Hegel’s
  absolute idealism is founded on a theory of the dialectics of labour similar
  to Marx’s historical materialism. Another significant discovery elucidates
  Hegel’s concept of poverty as the missing link which joins Marx’s
  formulation to classical liberal theory.%

    Marxism is a theory which originated in the context of nineteenth-century
  industrialised Europe. Despite its European origins, Marxism has actually
  found greatest significance as a doctrine for change in the context of the
  underdeveloped peasant societies of Asia. This paradox has only been resolved
  through adaptation of Marxism to suit the specific features of particular
  Asian societies. There has consequently been a differentiation of Marxism
  along national lines. In this book, first published in 1985, the theoretical
  and practical implications for this national differentiation of a
  ‘universal’ (European) theory are explored, followed by a more detailed
  analysis of the manner in which Marxism has developed during different
  historical periods in particular Asian contexts.%

    Today, Karl Marx is considered one of the preeminent social scientists of
  the last two centuries, and ranks among the most frequently assigned authors
  in university syllabi. However in Marx’s time, many competing sociological
  traditions and socialist political movements espoused similar ideas from
  different origin points. How did Marx emerge as preeminent? We hypothesize
  that the 1917 Russian Revolution is responsible for elevating Marx’s fame
  and intellectual following above his contemporary competitors. Using the
  synthetic control method and Google Ngram data, we construct a synthetic
  counterfactual for Marx’s citation patterns. This allows us to predict how
  often Marx would have been cited if the Russian Revolution had not happened.
  We find a significant treatment effect, meaning that Marx’s intellectual
  influence may be partly due to political accidents.%

  traces the development of Marx’s economic ideas from the Economic and

  gained much currency among Marxists in the twentieth century, and traces the
  development of debates surrounding the labour theory of value, and Marx’s
  writings on communism and “crisis.” These discussions remain pertinent
  today, and these texts vital to all those who wish to interpret and to change

    \field{abstract}{%
    Theories of violence against civilians in conflict have tended to view
  combatants in homogenous terms, as the obedient pawns of military elites, or
  as uniformly prone to violence due to passionate emotions or economic
  opportunism. In contrast, this study shows that combatant participation in
  violence is variable: While in some circumstances soldiers embrace violence
  eagerly, in others they attempt to shirk it or refuse to commit it outright.
  What accounts for this variation in violence and restraint? Why are some
  individuals, and some combat units, more likely to act violently than others?
  This dissertation examines these questions through a study of Israeli
  soldiers in the Second Intifada, employing interview, survey, and
  observational data. The core argument is that variation in combatant violence
  and restraint is a consequence of organizational control within the military.
  Drawing on theories in organizational and management studies, I define
  organizational control broadly to include not only formal mechanisms such as
  rules, discipline, and enforcement, but also informal mechanisms, such as the
  inculcation of values, norms, and beliefs through training and leadership.
  Through organizational control, the military seeks to align the preferences
  and beliefs of combatants regarding the use of violence with those of
  military leaders, ensuring that combatants both produce the violence demanded
  of them (strategic violence) and at the same time do not surpass or subvert
  such violence so that it no longer serves military interests but their own
  (opportunistic violence). I show that effective organizational control leads
  to participation patterns consistent with the preferences of armed group
  leaders - maximal participation in strategic violence and minimal
  participation in opportunistic violence. In contrast, weak control leads to
  participation patterns inconsistent with the preferences of armed group
  leaders - reduced participation in strategic violence and increased
  participation in opportunistic violence. When leader preferences are
  uncertain and control is ambiguous, new, entrepreneurial forms of violence
  emerge from the military's lower levels.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    One of the most important results of the French Revolution was the
  destruction of the old feudal order, which for centuries had kept the common
  people of the countryside subject to the lords. In this book, John Markoff
  addresses the ways in which insurrectionary peasants and revolutionary
  legislators joined in bringing the time of the lords to an end and how, in
  that ending, seigneurial rights came to be central to the very sense of the
  Revolution. He traces the interaction of peasants and legislators, showing
  how they confronted, challenged, and implicitly negotiated with one another
  during the course of events.Contrary to many historians who see the source of
  revolutionary change in elite culture, Markoff argues that peasant
  insurrection was a crucial element of the transformation of France. Of
  particular importance to the study is Markoff's analysis of the unique
  cahiers de doléances, the lists of grievances drawn up in 1789 by rural
  communities, urban notables, and nobles alike. These documents are invaluable
  for understanding the Revolution, but until the pioneering work of Markoff
  and Gilbert Shapiro, they had not been studied systematically at the national
  level. In addition to an unprecedented quantitative analysis of the cahiers,
  Markoff traces the ebb and flow of peasant insurrection across half a decade
  of revolutionary turbulence. He also offers qualitative analysis through his
  use of the records of the legislative debates as well as the memoirs and
  journals of the legislators. The Abolition of Feudalism breaks new ground in
  charting patterns of grievance and revolt in one of the most important social
  and political upheavals in history.%

    This book is a complete translation of Marx's critical commentary on
  paragraphs 261-313 of Hegel's major work in political theory. In this text
  Marx subjects Hegel's doctrine on the internal constitution of the state to a
  lengthy analysis. It was Marx's first attempt to expose and criticize Hegel's
  philosophy in general and his political philosophy in particular. It also
  represents his early efforts to criticize existing political institutions and
  to clarify the relations between the political and economic aspects of
  society. The Critique provides textual evidence in support of the argument
  that Marx's early writings do not exhibit radically different doctrinal
  principles and theoretical and practical concerns from his later work. This
  edition also includes a translation of the introduction Marx wrote for his
  proposed revised version of the Critique which he never completed. In a
  substantial introduction, Professor O'Malley provides valuable information on
  Marx's intellectual development.%

    This article describes a formal semantics for the deontic concepts -- the
  concepts of permission and obligation -- which arises naturally from the
  representations used in artificial intelligence systems Instead of treating
  deontic logic as a branch of modal logic, with the standard possible worlds
  semantics, we first develop a language for describing actions, and we define
  the concepts of permission and obligation in terms of these action
  descriptions. Using our semantic definitions, we then derive a number of
  intuitively plausible inferences, and we show generally that the paradoxes
  which are so frequently associated with deontic logic do not arise in our
  system.%

    Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course with Examples in R and Stan
  builds your knowledge of and confidence in making inferences from data.
  Reflecting the need for scripting in today's model-based statistics, the book
  pushes you to perform step-by-step calculations that are usually automated.
  This unique computational approach ensures that you understand enough of the
  details to make reasonable choices and interpretations in your own modeling
  work. The text presents causal inference and generalized linear multilevel
  models from a simple Bayesian perspective that builds on information theory
  and maximum entropy. The core material ranges from the basics of regression
  to advanced multilevel models. It also presents measurement error, missing
  data, and Gaussian process models for spatial and phylogenetic confounding.
  The second edition emphasizes the directed acyclic graph ({DAG}) approach to
  causal inference, integrating {DAGs} into many examples. The new edition also
  contains new material on the design of prior distributions, splines, ordered
  categorical predictors, social relations models, cross-validation, importance
  sampling, instrumental variables, and Hamiltonian Monte Carlo. It ends with
  an entirely new chapter that goes beyond generalized linear modeling, showing
  how domain-specific scientific models can be built into statistical analyses.
  Features Integrates working code into the main text Illustrates concepts
  through worked data analysis examples Emphasizes understanding assumptions
  and how assumptions are reflected in code Offers more detailed explanations
  of the mathematics in optional sections Presents examples of using the
  dagitty R package to analyze causal graphs Provides the rethinking R package
  on the author's website and on {GitHub}%

    This article presents a digital, open-access, multilingual, annotated
  corpus of electoral programs. It complements the recent methodological
  innovations in (semi-) computerized content analysis by providing a large,
  standardized text corpus for the political science community. The corpus is
  based on the collection of the Manifesto Project, which comprises of (at the
  time of writing) the largest hand-annotated text corpus of electoral programs
  available. Since 2009 the project’s costly and time-intensive procedure of
  collecting and coding documents has been fully digitized. As a result, it now
  provides more than 1800 machine readable documents from 40 different
  countries. Six hundred of these documents contain content-analyzed
  annotations at the level of single (quasi-) sentences, which correspond to
  the Manifesto Project coding scheme. Additionally, the corpus will
  continually be extended by incorporating new elections and digitizing older
  documents. The database also provides meta-information for each document (eg.
  party, election, language, etc.) that allow it to be referenced back to the
  Manifesto Dataset. The corpus is stored in a standardized format in an online
  database, and an {API} and R package ({manifestoR}) guarantee easy access.%

    The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method
  for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a
  large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this
  paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the
  vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we
  obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations.
  We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called
  negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their
  indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic
  phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily
  combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a
  simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector
  representations for millions of phrases is possible.%

    The Intifada inspired a new kind of Palestinian radicalism, a radicalism
  borne on young shoulders, a radicalism that conducts its dialogue with Israel
  and the local population via the stone, the slingshot, the petro bomb, and
  the leaflet. The leaflets bring the people into the streets and instruct them
  what to do, and when, and how. They determine the boundaries of the
  permissible. If one wants to know why the Intifada erupted, what the
  Palestinians think and what they are fighting for, how they operate and how
  they perceive Israel, and whether there is anything to talk about, one should
  read the Palestinian leaflets. They are the documents from which the
  Palestinians go forth and to which they return. Mishal and Aharoni first
  provide some historical background to the Intifada and deal with the question
  of how it came about and what prevented its outbreak during the first twenty
  years of Israeli rule in the territories. They then turn to the leaflets and
  examine in detail their contents and motivations. Speaking Stones concludes
  with a selection of over fifty translated leaflets of the two leading bodies
  in the Intifada: the United National Command and the Islamic Resistance
  Movement, known as Hamas.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In the mid-1970s, the Cold War had frozen into a nuclear stalemate in
  Europe and retreated from the headlines in Asia. As Gerald Ford and Jimmy
  Carter fought for the presidency in late 1976, the superpower struggle
  overseas seemed to take a backseat to more contentious domestic issues of
  race relations and rising unemployment. There was one continent, however,
  where the Cold War was on the point of flaring hot: Africa. Jimmy Carter in
  Africa opens just after Henry Kissinger's failed 1975 plot in Angola, as
  Carter launches his presidential campaign. The Civil Rights Act was only a
  decade old, and issues of racial justice remained contentious. Racism at home
  undermined Americans' efforts to win hearts and minds abroad and provided
  potent propaganda to the Kremlin. As President Carter confronted Africa, the
  essence of American foreign policy—stopping Soviet expansion—slammed up
  against the most explosive and raw aspect of American domestic
  politics—racism. Drawing on candid interviews with Carter, as well as key
  U.S. and foreign diplomats, and on a dazzling array of international archival
  sources, Nancy Mitchell offers a timely reevaluation of the Carter
  administration and of the man himself. In the face of two major tests, in
  Rhodesia and the Horn of Africa, Carter grappled with questions of Cold War
  competition, domestic politics, personal loyalty, and decision-making style.
  Mitchell reveals an administration not beset by weakness and indecision, as
  is too commonly assumed, but rather constrained by Cold War dynamics and by
  the president's own temperament as he wrestled with a divided public and his
  own human failings. Jimmy Carter in Africa presents a stark portrait of how
  deeply Cold War politics and racial justice were intertwined.%

    The period leading up to the Revolutions of 1848 was a seminal moment in
  the history of political thought, demarcating the ideological currents and
  defining the problems of freedom and social cohesion which are among the key
  issues of modern politics. This 2006 anthology offers research on Hegel's
  followers in the 1830s and 1840s. With essays by philosophers, political
  scientists, and historians from Europe and North America, it pays special
  attention to questions of state power, the economy, poverty, and labour, as
  well as to ideas on freedom. The book examines the political and social
  thought of Eduard Gans, Ludwig Feuerbach, Max Stirner, Bruno and Edgar Bauer,
  the young Engels, and Marx. It places them in the context of Hegel's
  philosophy, the Enlightenment, Kant, the French Revolution,
  industrialization, and urban poverty. It also views Marx and Engels in
  relation to their contemporaries and interlocutors in the Hegelian school.%

    The revolutions that swept across Europe in 1848 marked a turning-point in
  the history of political and social thought. They raised questions of
  democracy, nationhood, freedom and social cohesion that have remained among
  the key issues of modern politics, and still help to define the major
  ideological currents - liberalism, socialism, republicanism, anarchism,
  conservatism - in which these questions continue to be debated today. This
  collection of essays by internationally prominent historians of political
  thought examines the 1848 Revolutions in a pan-European perspective, and
  offers research on questions of state power, nationality, religion, the
  economy, poverty, labour, and freedom. Even where the revolutionary movements
  failed to achieve their explicit objectives of transforming the state and
  social relations, they set the agenda for subsequent regimes, and contributed
  to the shaping of modern European thought and institutions.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    From 1837, when he returned to England aboard the
  \${\textbackslash}textit\{{HMS} Beagle\}\$, to 1860, just after publication
  of \${\textbackslash}textit\{The Origin of Species\}\$, Charles Darwin kept
  detailed notes of each book he read or wanted to read. His notes and
  manuscripts provide information about decades of individual scientific
  practice. Previously, we trained topic models on the full texts of each
  reading, and applied information-theoretic measures to detect that changes in
  his reading patterns coincided with the boundaries of his three major
  intellectual projects in the period 1837-1860. In this new work we apply the
  reading model to five additional documents, four of them by Darwin: the first
  edition of \${\textbackslash}textit\{The Origin of Species\}\$, two private
  essays stating intermediate forms of his theory in 1842 and 1844, a third
  essay of disputed dating, and Alfred Russel Wallace's essay, which Darwin
  received in 1858. We address three historical inquiries, previously treated
  qualitatively: 1) the mythology of "Darwin's Delay," that despite completing
  an extensive draft in 1844, Darwin waited until 1859 to publish
  \${\textbackslash}textit\{The Origin of Species\}\$ due to external
  pressures; 2) the relationship between Darwin and Wallace's contemporaneous
  theories, especially in light of their joint presentation; and 3) dating of
  the "Outline and Draft" which was rediscovered in 1975 and postulated first
  as an 1839 draft preceding the Sketch of 1842, then as an interstitial draft
  between the 1842 and 1844 essays.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Written between 1857 and 1858, the Grundrisse is the first draft of Marx's
  critique of political economy and, thus, also the initial preparatory work on
  Capital. Despite its editorial vicissitudes and late publication, Grundrisse
  contains numerous reflections on matters that Marx did not develop elsewhere
  in his oeuvre and is therefore extremely important for an overall
  interpretation of his thought. In this collection, various international
  experts in the field, analysing the Grundrisse on the 150th anniversary of
  its composition, present a Marx in many ways radically different from the one
  who figures in the dominant currents of twentieth-century Marxism. The book
  demonstrates the relevance of the Grundrisse to an understanding of Capital
  and of Marx's theoretical project as a whole, which, as is well known,
  remained uncompleted. It also highlights the continuing explanatory power of
  Marxian categories for contemporary society and its present contradictions.
  With contributions from such scholars as Eric Hobsbawm and Terrell Carver,
  and covering subject areas such as political economy, philosophy and Marxism,
  this book is likely to become required reading for serious scholars of Marx
  across the world.%

    Contrary to the predictions that after 1989 Karl Marx would fall into
  oblivion, Marx has returned to the attention of international scholars. One
  hundred and sixty years after it was written, the Manifesto of the Communist
  Party is celebrated as the text which contains the most formidable prediction
  of capitalist development on a world scale. This article considers how the
  writings of Marx and Engels were translated and assimilated in Italy, from
  its first appearance in 1889 to 1945 and, more generally, explores the
  misinterpretations of the fortune of Marx's works in Italy. From a close
  examination of the press of the newly established workers' movement and the
  first socialist writings, the reality of a counterfeited and theoretically
  impoverished 'Marxism' emerges. Antonio Labriola's Essays on the Materialist
  Conception of History, which were published between 1895 and 1897, were the
  only works in Italy that offered a rigorous interpretation capable of
  measuring up to the European levels of Marxism. Through the historiographical
  reconstruction of translated works and the development of the interpretations
  of Marx and Engels' The Communist Manifesto, this article considers the
  debate on the 'crisis of Marxism' of the late 19th century in which Benedetto
  Croce was the most important figure, the limitations of the diffusion of
  Marx's theories in the Italian Socialist Party, the struggle between
  reformist and the union-revolutionary revisionism of the early 20th century
  and the repression of 20 years of fascism.%

    This book is available as open access through the Bloomsbury Open Access
  programme and is available on www.bloomsburycollections.com.Major political
  and economic shifts have succeeded one another over the past twenty-five
  years. The rise to prominence of ecological issues, social changes generated
  by neoliberal globalization, and - most recently - one of the worst world
  economic crises ever, compels us to reflect urgently on the need for
  alternatives to the capitalist system. In its brief life, the International
  Working Men's Association ({IWMA}) became the symbol of class struggle and
  influenced the ideas of millions of workers all over the planet. The 150th
  anniversary of its birth (1864-2014) offers an important opportunity to
  reread their resolutions, to learn from the experiences of its protagonists,
  and to better theorize solutions to our contemporary issues. This sourcebook
  includes the most valuable documents (30 appearing for the first time in
  English) of all the currents of the {IWMA}, and, in his introduction,
  acclaimed scholar Marcello Musto provides critical evaluations to the texts
  and to their historical context. Carefully selected and translated, this
  volume is an invaluable resource for all those interested in the foundations
  of labor movement history's as well as in the critique of capitalism.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Marx was regarded as a thinker
  doomed to oblivion about whom everything had already been said and written.
  However, the international economic crisis of 2008 favoured a return to his
  analysis of capitalism, and recently published volumes of the
  Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe ({MEGA}2) have provided researchers with new texts
  that underline the gulf between Marx's critical theory and the dogmatism of
  many twentieth-century Marxisms. This work reconstructs with great textual
  and historical rigour, but in a form accessible to those encountering Marx
  for the first time, a number of little noted, or often misunderstood, stages
  in his intellectual biography. The book is divided into three parts. The
  first – 'Intellectual Influences and Early Writings' – investigates the
  formation of the young Marx and the composition of his Parisian manuscripts
  of 1844. The second – 'The Critique of Political Economy' – focuses on
  the genesis of Marx's magnum opus, beginning with his studies of political
  economy in the early 1850s and following his labours through to all the
  preparatory manuscripts for Capital. The third – 'Political Militancy' –
  presents an insightful history of the International Working Men's Association
  and of the role that Marx played in that organization. The volume offers a
  close and innovative examination of Marx's ideas on post-Hegelian philosophy,
  alienated labour, the materialist conception of history, research methods,
  the theory of surplus-value, working-class self-emancipation, political
  organization and revolutionary theory. From this emerges “another Marx”,
  a thinker very different from the one depicted by so many of his critics and
  ostensible disciples.%

    Faced with a new crisis of capitalism, many scholars are now looking back
  to the author whose ideas were too hastily dismissed after the fall of the
  Berlin Wall. During the last decade, Marx’s Capital has received renewed
  academic and popular attention. It has been reprinted in new editions
  throughout the world and the contemporary relevance of its pages is being
  discussed again. Today, Marx’s analyses are arguably resonating even more
  strongly than they did in his own time and Capital continues to provide an
  effective framework to understand the nature of capitalism and its
  transformations. This volume includes the proceedings of the biggest
  international conference held in the world to celebrate the 150th anniversary
  of Capital’s publication. The book is divided into three parts: I)
  "Capitalism, Past and Present"; {II}) "Extending the Critique of Capital";
  {III}) "The Politics of Capital". It contains the contributions of globally
  renowned scholars from 13 countries and multiple academic disciplines who
  offer diverse perspectives, and critical insights into the principal
  contradictions of contemporary capitalism while pointing to alternative
  economic and social models. Together, they reconsider the most influential
  historical debates on Capital and provide new interpretations of Marx’s
  magnum opus in light of themes rarely associated with Capital, such as
  gender, ecology, and non-European societies. The book is an indispensable
  source for academic communities who are increasingly interested in
  rediscovering Marx beyond 20th century Marxism. Moreover, it will be of great
  appeal to students, as well as established scholars interested in critique of
  capitalism and socialist theory.%

    An innovative reassessment of the last writings and final years of Karl
  Marx. In the last years of his life, Karl Marx expanded his research in new
  directions—studying recent anthropological discoveries, analyzing communal
  forms of ownership in precapitalist societies, supporting the populist
  movement in Russia, and expressing critiques of colonial oppression in India,
  Ireland, Algeria, and Egypt. Between 1881 and 1883, he also traveled beyond
  Europe for the first and only time. Focusing on these last years of Marx's
  life, this book dispels two key misrepresentations of his work: that Marx
  ceased to write late in life, and that he was a Eurocentric and economic
  thinker fixated on class conflict alone. With The Last Years of Karl Marx,
  Marcello Musto claims a renewed relevance for the late work of Marx,
  highlighting unpublished or previously neglected writings, many of which
  remain unavailable in English. Readers are invited to reconsider Marx's
  critique of European colonialism, his ideas on non-Western societies, and his
  theories on the possibility of revolution in noncapitalist countries. From
  Marx's late manuscripts, notebooks, and letters emerge an author markedly
  different from the one represented by many of his contemporary critics and
  followers alike. As Marx currently experiences a significant rediscovery,
  this volume fills a gap in the popularly accepted biography and suggests an
  innovative reassessment of some of his key concepts.%

    "The alienation of humankind, in the fundamental sense of the term, means
  the loss of control: its embodiment in an alien force which confronts the
  individuals as a hostile and potentially destructive power. When Marx
  analysed alienation in his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, he
  indicated four principal aspects of it - the alienation of human beings from:
  (1) nature ; (2) their own productive activity ; (3) their 'species being',
  as members of the human species; and (4) each other. He forcefully underlined
  that all this is not some 'fatality of nature' - as indeed as the structural
  antagonisms of capital are characteristically misrepresented, so as to leave
  them in their place - but a form of self-alienation. In other words, not the
  deed of an all-powerful outside agency, natural or metaphysical, but the
  outcome of a determinate type of historical development which can be
  positively altered by a conscious intervention in the historical process, in
  order to 'transcend labour's self-alienation'."--Preface.%

    Strife has raged about Karl Marx for decades, and never had it been so
  embittered as at the time of this book’s first publication, 1936. Marx had
  impressed his image on the time as not other had done. To some he was – and
  still is – a fiend, the arch-enemy of human civilisation, and the prince of
  chaos, while to others he is a far-seeing and beloved leader, guiding the
  human race towards a brighter future. The arena in which Marx was fought

    This dissertation explores why some Muslim clerics adopt the ideology of
  militant Jihad while others do not. I argue that clerics strategically adopt
  or reject Jihadi ideology because of career incentives generated by the
  structure of cleric educational networks. Well-connected clerics enjoy
  substantial success at pursuing comfortable careers within state-run
  religious institutions and they reject Jihadi ideology in exchange for
  continued material support from the state. Clerics with poor educational
  networks cannot rely on connections to advance through the state-run
  institutions, so many pursue careers outside of the system by appealing
  directly to lay audiences for support. These clerics are more likely to adopt
  Jihadi ideology because it helps them demonstrate to potential supporters
  that they have not been theologically coopted by political elites. I provide
  evidence of these dynamics by collecting and analyzing 27,142 fatwas,
  articles, and books written by 101 contemporary clerics. Using statistical
  natural language processing, I measure the extent to which each cleric adopts
  Jihadi ideology in their writing. I combine this with biographical and
  network information about each cleric to trace the process by which
  poorly-connected clerics become more likely to adopt Jihadi ideology.%

    Following Converse's advice that ideology is the product of a 'creative
  synthesis,' conducted by a narrow group of intellectuals, this paper reports
  on attempts to study ideology at its point of creation. I develop a measure
  of ideology expressed among pundits, based on coded opinion pieces in
  magazines and newspapers from 1830 to 1990. I use this measure to test the
  impact of ideas on party coalitions. I argue that ideologies, as created by
  intellectuals, strongly influence the coalitions that party leaders advance.
  In three cases the realignment on slavery before the Civil War, the Civil
  Rights realignment in the mid-20th century, and the party change on abortion
  more recently there is evidence that intellectuals reorganize the issues
  before parties realign around them. This evidence suggests that the patterns
  of 'what goes with what' that intellectuals design have an impact on the
  nature of political cleavages.%

    Joseph Nye coined the term "soft power" in the late 1980s. It is now used
  frequently—and often incorrectly—by political leaders, editorial writers,
  and academics around the world. So what is soft power? Soft power lies in the
  ability to attract and persuade. Whereas hard power—the ability to
  coerce—grows out of a country's military or economic might, soft power
  arises from the attractiveness of a country's culture, political ideals, and
  policies. Hard power remains crucial in a world of states trying to guard
  their independence and of non-state groups willing to turn to violence. It
  forms the core of the Bush administration's new national security strategy.
  But according to Nye, the neo-conservatives who advise the president are
  making a major miscalculation: They focus too heavily on using America's
  military power to force other nations to do our will, and they pay too little
  heed to our soft power. It is soft power that will help prevent terrorists
  from recruiting supporters from among the moderate majority. And it is soft
  power that will help us deal with critical global issues that require
  multilateral cooperation among states. That is why it is so essential that
  America better understands and applies our soft power. This book is our
  guide.%

    Texts expressed in legal language are often difficult and time consuming
  for lawyers to read through, particularly for the purpose of identifying
  relevant deontic modalities (obligations, prohibitions and permissions). By
  nature, the language of law is strict, hence the predominant use of modal
  logic as a substitute for the syntactical ambiguity in natural language,
  specifically, deontic and alethic logic for the respective modalities.
  However, deontic modalities which express obligations, prohibitions and
  permissions, can have varying degree and preciseness to which they correspond
  to a matter, strict deontic logic does not allow for such quantitative
  measures. Therefore, this paper outlines a data-driven approach by
  classifying deontic modalities using ensembled Artificial Neural Networks
  ({ANN}) that incorporate domain specific legal distributional semantic model
  ({DSM}) representations, in combination with, a general {DSM} representation.
  We propose to use well calibrated probability estimates from these
  classifiers as an approximation to the degree which an obligation/prohibition
  or permission belongs to a given class based on {SME} annotated sentences.
  Best results show 82.33 \% accuracy on a held-out test set.%

    Since the publication of F. R. Palmer's Mood and Modality in 1986, when the

  grammatical category found in most of the languages of the world. Palmer
  investigates this category, drawing on a wealth of examples from a wide

    The article examines the interrelationship among propaganda, effect, and
  the Cold War during congressional debates over America's first peacetime
  propaganda program. Although the rise of the communication research paradigm
  affected the production of statistical evidence to measure the effectiveness
  of America's Cold War propaganda, this case study argues that the “war of
  words” metaphor further heightened the need for empirical proof of
  America's status in that conflict, Just as with any physical battle that
  relies on body counts and land measurements to determine the success of
  America's war efforts, the criteria for measuring the status of America's
  “war of words” were driven by a similar demand for “objective” proof.
  The longevity of the Cold War helped ensure the institutionalization of the
  communication research paradigm, which rejected the use of anecdotal evidence
  as support for the program's impact.%

    This study involves a methodology for the automatic identification of
  semantic features and document clusters in a heterogeneous text collection.
  The methodology is based upon encoding the data using low rank non-negative
  matrix factorization algorithms to preserve natural data non-negativity and
  thus avoid subtractive basis vector and encoding interactions present in
  techniques such as principal component analysis. Some existing non-negative
  matrix factorization techniques are reviewed and some new ones are proposed.
  Numerical experiments are reported on the use of a hybrid {NMF} algorithm to
  produce a parts-based approximation of a sparse term-by-document matrix. The
  resulting basis vectors and matrix projection can be used to identify
  underlying semantic features (topics) and document clusters of the
  corresponding text collection.%

    Plato's Republic is widely acknowledged as the cornerstone of Western
  philosophy. Presented in the form of a dialogue between Socrates and three
  different interlocutors, it is an enquiry into the notion of a perfect
  community and the ideal individual within it. During the conversation other
  questions are raised: what is goodness; what is reality; what is knowledge?
  The Republic also addresses the purpose of education and the role of both
  women and men as 'guardians' of the people. With remarkable lucidity and deft
  use of allegory, Plato arrives at a depiction of a state bound by harmony and
  ruled by 'philosopher kings'.%

    Originally published in 1975, The Machiavellian Moment remains a landmark
  of historical and political thought. Celebrated historian J.G.A. Pocock looks
  at the consequences for modern historical and social consciousness arising
  from the ideal of the classical republic revived by Machiavelli and other
  thinkers of Renaissance Italy. Pocock shows that Machiavelli's prime emphasis
  was on the moment in which the republic confronts the problem of its own
  instability in time, which Pocock calls the "Machiavellian moment."After
  examining this problem in the works of Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and
  Giannotti, Pocock turns to the revival of republican ideology in Puritan
  England and in Revolutionary and Federalist America. He argues that the
  American Revolution can be considered the last great act of civic humanism of
  the Renaissance and he relates the origins of modern historicism to the clash
  between civic, Christian, and commercial values in eighteenth-century
  thought.This Princeton Classics edition of The Machiavellian Moment features
  a new introduction by Richard Whatmore.%

    “Very few men,” said Bakunin, “have read as much, and, it may be

  influential work explores how the world of imaginative literature—poems,
  novels, plays—infused and shaped Marx’s writings, from his unpublished
  correspondence, to his pamphlets and major works. In exploring Marx’s use
  of literary texts, from Aeschylus to Balzac, and the central role of art and
  literature in the development of his critical vision, Karl Marx and World
  Literature is a forensic masterpiece of critical analysis.%

    {BERT} (Devlin et al., 2018) and {RoBERTa} (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new
  state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic
  textual similarity ({STS}). However, it requires that both sentences are fed
  into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the
  most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50
  million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with {BERT}. The
  construction of {BERT} makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as
  well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we
  present Sentence-{BERT} ({SBERT}), a modification of the pretrained {BERT}
  network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive
  semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using
  cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair
  from 65 hours with {BERT} / {RoBERTa} to about 5 seconds with {SBERT}, while
  maintaining the accuracy from {BERT}. We evaluate {SBERT} and {SRoBERTa} on
  common {STS} tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other
  state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.%

    Word embeddings, the coefficients from neural network models predicting the
  use of words in context, have now become inescapable in applications
  involving natural language processing. Despite a few studies in political
  science, the potential of this methodology for the analysis of political
  texts has yet to be fully uncovered. This paper introduces models of word
  embeddings augmented with political metadata and trained on large-scale
  parliamentary corpora from Britain, Canada, and the United States. We fit
  these models with indicator variables of the party affiliation of members of
  parliament, which we refer to as party embeddings. We illustrate how these
  embeddings can be used to produce scaling estimates of ideological placement
  and other quantities of interest for political research. To validate the
  methodology, we assess our results against indicators from the Comparative
  Manifestos Project, surveys of experts, and measures based on roll-call
  votes. Our findings suggest that party embeddings are successful at capturing
  latent concepts such as ideology, and the approach provides researchers with
  an integrated framework for studying political language.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Marx’s Inferno reconstructs the major arguments of Karl Marx’s Capital
  and inaugurates a completely new reading of a seminal classic. Rather than
  simply a critique of classical political economy, William Roberts argues that
  Capital was primarily a careful engagement with the motives and aims of the
  workers’ movement. Understood in this light, Capital emerges as a profound
  work of political theory. Placing Marx against the background of
  nineteenth-century socialism, Roberts shows how Capital was ingeniously
  modeled on Dante’s Inferno, and how Marx, playing the role of Virgil for
  the proletariat, introduced partisans of workers’ emancipation to the
  secret depths of the modern “social Hell.” In this manner, Marx revised
  republican ideas of freedom in response to the rise of capitalism.Combining
  research on Marx’s interlocutors, textual scholarship, and forays into
  recent debates, Roberts traces the continuities linking Marx’s theory of
  capitalism to the tradition of republican political thought. He immerses the
  reader in socialist debates about the nature of commerce, the experience of
  labor, the power of bosses and managers, and the possibilities of political
  organization. Roberts rescues those debates from the past, and shows how they
  speak to ever-renewed concerns about political life in today’s world.%

    As John Roemer says in his introduction to this volume, 'During the past
  decade, what now appears as a new species in social theory has been forming:
  analytically sophisticated Marxism. Its practitioners are largely inspired by
  Marxian questions which they pursue with contemporary tools of logic,
  mathematics, and model building ... These writers are, self-consciously,
  products of both the Marxian and non-Marxian traditions.' This volume
  assembles substantial and original essays, both published and unpublished, by
  some of the leading practitioners of 'analytical Marxism'. The essays discuss
  a number of the fundamental issues of Marxian thought as well as questions
  that conventional Marxists see no need to raise. They exemplify the ways in
  which analytical Marxists are beginning to reinvigorate the Marxian tradition
  and, in doing so, to break down the barriers that have divided it from other
  forms of social theory. The volume will make an excellent textbook and an
  ideal introduction to this new approach.%

    Professor Roemer's goal in this book is to give a rigorous view of
  classical Marxian economic theory by presenting specific analytic models. The
  theory is not extended to deal with new problems, but it is deepened: Marxian
  theory is given micro-foundations and upon those foundations the author
  begins to rebuild a tightly constructed Marxian economics. The book begins,
  after a methodological introduction, with an examination of the Marxian
  notion of equilibrium and the theory of exploitation, and goes on to deal
  with the theory of the falling rate of profit. The next section explores one
  of the points made in the first section of the book, that the Marxian theory
  of exploitation can be constructed completely independently of the labor
  theory of value as a theory of exchange. Technical study of this problem
  allows comment on various issues, such as the relative importance of
  "marginal utilities" and "class struggle" in determining relative prices. The
  final part examines models of various Marxian concepts.%

    Now in its fifth edition, Diffusion of Innovations is a classic work on the
  spread of new ideas.In this renowned book, Everett M. Rogers, professor and
  chair of the Department of Communication \& Journalism at the University of
  New Mexico, explains how new ideas spread via communication channels over
  time. Such innovations are initially perceived as uncertain and even risky.
  To overcome this uncertainty, most people seek out others like themselves who
  have already adopted the new idea. Thus the diffusion process consists of a
  few individuals who first adopt an innovation, then spread the word among
  their circle of acquaintances—a process which typically takes months or
  years. But there are exceptions: use of the Internet in the 1990s, for
  example, may have spread more rapidly than any other innovation in the
  history of humankind. Furthermore, the Internet is changing the very nature
  of diffusion by decreasing the importance of physical distance between
  people. The fifth edition addresses the spread of the Internet, and how it
  has transformed the way human beings communicate and adopt new ideas.%

    Correlation does not imply causation; but often, observational data are the
  only option, even though the research question at hand involves causality.
  This article discusses causal inference based on observational data,
  introducing readers to graphical causal models that can provide a powerful
  tool for thinking more clearly about the interrelations between variables.
  Topics covered include the rationale behind the statistical control of third
  variables, common procedures for statistical control, and what can go wrong
  during their implementation. Certain types of third variables—colliders and
  mediators—should not be controlled for because that can actually move the
  estimate of an association away from the value of the causal effect of
  interest. More subtle variations of such harmful control include using
  unrepresentative samples, which can undermine the validity of causal
  conclusions, and statistically controlling for mediators. Drawing valid
  causal inferences on the basis of observational data is not a mechanistic
  procedure but rather always depends on assumptions that require domain
  knowledge and that can be more or less plausible. However, this caveat holds
  not only for research based on observational data, but for all empirical
  research endeavors.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Über den Beitrag des Marxismus zur Erforschung der Geschichte ist bereits
  so viel geschrieben, daß die Literatur zu diesem Thema kaurn noch
  überschaubar ist; auf den Beitrag der Geschichtswissenschaft zur Erforschung
  des Marxismus, d.h. primär der Ansichten von Marx, wird kaum je eingegangen
  — was nicht so erstaunlich scheint. Daß der Marxismus nicht nur eine
  Theorie der Geschichte, sondern ebenso selbst ein historisches Phänomen ist;
  daß die Geschichtswissenschaft den Sinn der Marxschen Ansichten durch die
  Erforschung der Genese zu erhellen sucht; daß sie sich dabei nicht nur, aber
  in erster Linie auf Marx' eigene — sei es von ihm publizierte, sei es
  hinterlassene — Texte stützt; daß sie, soweit möglich, von den
  originalen Texten, d.h. dem von Marx selbst beschriebenen Papier — um
  diesen handfest-stofflichen Aspekt der originalen Texte einmal zu betonen —
  auszugehen hat: all das bedarf kaum der Erwähnung. Erwahnung. Dasselbe gilt
  wohl hinsichtlich der Regeln, gemäß denen bei der Auswertung der Texte
  vorzugehen ist. Die Geschichtswissenschaft hat die betreffenden Verfahren vor
  Marx, unabhängig von ihm ausgebildet; sie bedient sich ihrer generell. Daß
  es jedoch, was die Erforschung des Marxismus angeht, dennoch — hundert
  Jahre nach dem Tod von Marx — nicht überflüssig ist, besonders auf sie
  hinzuweisen, zeigt der Fall der Manuskripte aus dem Jahre 1844 (fortan:
  Manuskripte), die bekanntlich in der Diskussion der letzten fünfzig Jahre
  eine nicht geringe Rolle gespielt haben.%

    The present work is aimed at filling a hiatus in the literature dealing
  with the Young Hegelians and the early thought of Karl Marx. Despite the
  prevalent view in the past few decades that Bruno Bauer played an important
  part in the radical activity of Hegel's young disciples in the eighteen
  forties in Germany, no comprehensive work has so far been published on the
  relations between Bauer and Marx. In 1927 Ernst Bar nikol promised to write a
  monograph on the subject, but he never did. For the purpose of this study I
  perused material in numerous library collections and I would like to express
  my gratitude to the staff of the following institutions: Tel Aviv University
  Library, the Library and Archive of the International Institute of Social
  History in Am sterdam, the Heidelberg University Library, the Library of
  Gottingen University, the Tiibingen University Library, Frankfurt University

    For a century now Marxists have been searching for a 'rational kernel' of
  Hegelian 'dialectics' inside the 'mystical shell' of the Hegelian system. As
  against this entire tradition, Rosenthal insists that Hegelian philosophy is
  mysticism all the way through. He argues that Marx's supposed 'dialectic
  method' is simply a myth propagated by academics and proposes the provocative
  thesis that it is not, after all, Hegel's 'method' of which Marx made use in
  Capital but rather precisely Hegel's mysticism. The role of money in Marx and
  Hegel is examined in detail.%

    Comment Marx travaillait-il? La question prend une importance toute

  éclairer, non seulement sur le sens réel des oeuvres inachevées ou
  posthumes, mais encore, à n'en pas douter, sur l'ensemble de l'oeuvre.Aucun
  examen de détail n'a été tenté pour étudier une méthode de travail que
  l'on sait ou devine pourtant toute personnelle, et, plus particulièrement,
  opposée à celle de Hegel. Un critique russe ayant commenté la methode
  dialectique de Marx, celui-ci ajoute à la seconde edition du Capital les
  réflexions que voici: «…le procédé d'exposition doit se distvnguci
  formellement du procédé d'investigation. A l'investigation de faire la
  matière sienne dans tous ses détails, d'en analyser les diverses formes de
  développement, et de découvrir leur lien intime.%

    Marx a lu pendant près de sept ans les ouvrages des économistes et en a

  ses recherches, et s'apprête à rédiger l'oeuvre méditée. L'accueil des
  éditeurs allemands ne l'y encourage guère. Malade, sans ressources, il se
  voit offrir la correspondance européenne d'un grand quotidien new-yorkais et
  accepte avec empressement. Le problème est d'écrire en anglais. Il aura
  recours à Engels et signera les articles que son anti lui enverra pendant

    Word embeddings are a powerful approach for unsupervised analysis of
  language. Recently, Rudolph et al. developed exponential family embeddings,
  which cast word embeddings in a probabilistic framework. Here, we develop
  dynamic embeddings, building on exponential family embeddings to capture how
  the meanings of words change over time. We use dynamic embeddings to analyze
  three large collections of historical texts: the U.S. Senate speeches from
  1858 to 2009, the history of computer science {ACM} abstracts from 1951 to
  2014, and machine learning papers on the {ArXiv} from 2007 to 2015. We find
  dynamic embeddings provide better fits than classical embeddings and capture
  interesting patterns about how language changes.%

    This study reveals that the entry into World War I in 1917 indexed the
  decisive transition to the modern period in American political consciousness,
  ushering in new objects of political discourse, a more rapid pace of change
  of those objects, and a fundamental reframing of the main tasks of
  governance. We develop a strategy for identifying meaningful categories in
  textual corpora that span long historic durées, where terms, concepts, and
  language use changes. Our approach is able to account for the fluidity of
  discursive categories over time, and to analyze their continuity by
  identifying the discursive stream as the object of interest.%

    Before Freakonomics and The Tipping Point there was this classic by the
  2005 Nobel Laureate in Economics. "Schelling here offers an early analysis of
  'tipping' in social situations involving a large number of individuals."
  —official citation for the 2005 Nobel Prize Micromotives and Macrobehavior
  was originally published over twenty-five years ago, yet the stories it tells
  feel just as fresh today. And the subject of these stories—how small and
  seemingly meaningless decisions and actions by individuals often lead to
  significant unintended consequences for a large group—is more important
  than ever. In one famous example, Thomas C. Schelling shows that a
  slight-but-not-malicious preference to have neighbors of the same race
  eventually leads to completely segregated populations. The updated edition of
  this landmark book contains a new preface and the author's Nobel Prize
  acceptance speech.%

    This pathbreaking work reports on the methods, and some of the results, of
  a content analysis of the cahiers de doléances, the well-known lists of
  grievances in which, in 1789, the French people expressed their
  dissatisfactions with the state of their society and their hopes for a better
  future. The analysis is an outgrowth of a larger research project,
  "Quantitative Studies of the French Revolution," conducted by the authors and
  others over a thirty-year period. The central data of the research for this
  book are a coding of a national sample of documents representing the views of
  rural parishes, the Nobility, and the Third Estate. These codes, together
  with data on the economic, social, and political conditions of the regions of
  France under the Old Regime and data on political behavior during the
  revolutionary period, form a computerized data archive to be made available
  to researchers. The book is in four parts. Part I describes content analysis
  as a method and its varieties, controversies, and problems. Part {II}
  discusses the cahiers and their authenticity and usefulness as a historical
  source. Part {III} considers the coding procedures, information about the
  sample, and studies bearing on the evaluation of the coding process. Part
  {IV}, the largest part of the book, presents some of the authors' findings to
  date, including a summary of the concerns expressed by the nation in 1789, a
  study of the attitudes toward the monarchy, an analysis of consensus and
  conflict among the Estates, and the influence of social mobility upon
  political radicalism. Appendixes provide details of the coding, the national
  frequencies of many grievance categories, lists of sources of coded cahiers,
  and maps indicating the data's coverage of France.%

    This article seeks to contextualize Marx's path to the Capital volumes
  through what might be called its 'international dimension'. It explores how
  Marx experienced an array of differentially developed yet related societies
  through a consciousness of backwardness, and how this consciousness moulded
  his praxis. In this respect, the article takes issue with the Marxist
  assumption that the silence in Capital regarding the multi-linear character
  of modern world development is ultimately non-harmful to the volumes'
  uni-linear notion of modern world development. The aim of the article is
  essentially to clear the way for a more rigorous Historical Materialist
  appreciation of multi-linearity in modern world development. It does so by
  arguing that the condition of multi-linearity in modern world development
  formed the very terrain upon which Marx intellectually journeyed towards
  Capital. Specifically, the framing of the Capital volumes around a singular
  dialectic of social transformation should be considered as the failed outcome
  of Marx's pre-existing engagement with the problem of multi-linearity. This
  argument has ramifications for contemporary Marxist understandings of world
  development, as well as demonstrating the general importance of
  contextualizing political thought through an international rather than
  national or universal historical narrative.%

    Since many legal disputes are battles over the meaning of a statute,
  contract, testimony, or the Constitution, judges must interpret language in
  order to decide why one proposed meaning overrides another. And in making
  their decisions about meaning appear authoritative and fair, judges often
  write about the nature of linguistic interpretation. In the first book to
  examine the linguistic analysis of law, Lawrence M. Solan shows that judges
  sometimes inaccurately portray the way we use language, creating
  inconsistencies in their decisions and threatening the fairness of the
  judicial system. Solan uses a wealth of examples to illustrate the way
  linguistics enters the process of judicial decision making: a death penalty
  case that the Supreme Court decided by analyzing the use of adjectives in a
  jury instruction; criminal cases whose outcomes depend on the Supreme
  Court’s analysis of the relationship between adverbs and prepositional
  phrases; and cases focused on the meaning of certain words in the
  Constitution. Solan finds that judges often describe our use of language
  poorly because there is no clear relationship between the principles of
  linguistics and the jurisprudential goals that the judge wishes to promote. A
  major contribution to the growing interdisciplinary scholarship on law and
  its social and cultural context, Solan’s lucid, engaging book is equally
  accessible to linguists, lawyers, philosophers, anthropologists, literary
  theorists, and political scientists.%

    Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize (Biography) A New York Times Book Review
  Editors Choice Selection Named one of the Best Books of the Year by
  Publishers Weekly and Book Riot “Absorbing, meticulously researched....
  [Sperber] succeeds in the primary task of all biography, re-creating a man
  who leaps off the page.” —Jonathan Freedland, New York Times Book Review
  In this magisterial biography of Karl Marx, “likely to be definitive for
  many years to come” (John Gray, New York Review of Books), historian
  Jonathan Sperber creates a meticulously researched and multilayered portrait
  of both the man and the revolutionary times in which he lived. Based on
  unprecedented access to the recently opened archives of Marx’s and
  Engels’s complete writings, Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life provides a
  historical context for the personal story of one of the most influential and
  controversial political philosophers in Western history. By removing Marx
  from the ideological conflicts of the twentieth century that colored his
  legacy and placing him within “the society and intellectual currents of the
  nineteenth century” (Ian Kershaw), Sperber is able to present a full
  portrait of Marx as neither a soothsaying prophet of the modern world nor the
  author of its darkest atrocities. This major biography fundamentally reshapes
  our understanding of a towering historical figure.%

    We consider the impact of the Second Reform Act, and the doubling of the
  electorate it delivered, on the linguistic complexity of speeches made by
  members of parliament in Britain. Noting that the new voters were generally
  poorer and less educated than those who already enjoyed the suffrage, we
  hypothesize that cabinet ministers had strong incentives—relative to other
  members—to appeal to these new electors with simpler statements during
  parliamentary debates. We assess this claim with a data set of over half a
  million speeches for the period between the Great Reform Act and Great War,
  along with methods for measuring the comprehensibility of texts—which we
  validate in some detail. The theorized relationship holds: ministers become
  statistically significantly easier to understand (on average) relative to
  backbenchers, and this effect occurs almost immediately after the 1868
  election. We show that this result is not an artifact of new personnel in the
  House of Commons.%

    The years of the first industrial revolution saw a remarkable flowering of
  radical social criticism in Britain. This is a study of the ideas that
  emerged then and of the social and intellectual conditions from which they
  developed. Dr Stafford begins in Part I by presenting what will be seen as a
  very valuable general account of the historical and cultural setting, showing
  how the language of social debate had been affected by intellectual
  developments and the increasingly rapid transformations of society. Then in
  Part {II} he discusses ten major critics of British society, from Thomas
  Spence to William Cobbett, who represent a wide range of political opinion
  from anarchism to Tory radicalism. Dr. Stafford takes a key text by each
  author, sets out its argument, and analyzes it both critically and
  historically, showing the particular influences that shaped it and revealing
  the ways in which the social thought of the time resembles or diverges from
  our own. This book will help to recover from unwarranted neglect this
  important tradition of writing that did much to form subsequent thinking
  about society. It will make a valuable contribution to the study of the
  literature and the social and intellectual history of the period.%

    As much a portrait of his time as a biography of the man, Karl Marx:
  Greatness and Illusion returns the author of Das Kapital to his
  nineteenth-century world, before twentieth-century inventions transformed him
  into Communism's patriarch and fierce lawgiver. Gareth Stedman Jones depicts
  an era dominated by extraordinary challenges and new notions about God, human
  capacities, empires, and political systems--and, above all, the shape of the
  future. In the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, a Europe-wide argument
  began about the industrial transformation of England, the Revolution in
  France, and the hopes and fears generated by these occurrences. Would the
  coming age belong to those enthralled by the revolutionary events and ideas
  that had brought this world into being, or would its inheritors be those who
  feared and loathed it? Stedman Jones gives weight not only to Marx's views
  but to the views of those with whom he contended. He shows that Marx was as
  buffeted as anyone else living through a period that both confirmed and
  confounded his interpretations--and that ultimately left him with terrible
  intimations of failure. Karl Marx allows the reader to understand Marx's
  milieu and development, and makes sense of the devastating impact of new ways
  of seeing the world conjured up by Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Ricardo,
  Saint-Simon, and others. We come to understand how Marx transformed and
  adapted their philosophies into ideas that would have--through twists and
  turns inconceivable to him--an overwhelming impact across the globe in the
  twentieth century.%

    "All political action has . . . in itself a directedness towards knowledge
  of the good: of the good life, or of the good society. For the good society
  is the complete political good. If this directedness becomes explicit, if men
  make it their explicit goal to acquire knowledge of the good life and of the
  good society, political philosophy emerges. . . . The theme of political
  philosophy is mankind’s great objectives, freedom and government or
  empire—objectives which are capable of lifting all men beyond their poor
  selves. Political philosophy is that branch of philosophy which is closest to
  political life, to non-philosophic life, to human life."—From "What Is
  Political Philosophy?" What Is Political Philosophy?—a collection of ten
  essays and lectures and sixteen book reviews written between 1943 and
  1957—contains some of Leo Strauss’s most famous writings and some of his
  most explicit statements of the themes that made him famous. The title essay
  records Strauss’s sole extended articulation of the meaning of political
  philosophy itself. Other essays discuss the relation of political philosophy
  to history, give an account of the political philosophy of the non-Christian
  Middle Ages and of classic European modernity, and present his theory of
  esoteric writing.%

    We present a structured random-walk model that captures key aspects of how
  people communicate in groups. Our model takes the form of a correlated
  L{\textbackslash}'\{e\}vy flight that quantifies the balance between focused
  discussion of an idea and long-distance leaps in semantic space. We apply our
  model to three cases of increasing structural complexity: philosophical texts
  by Aristotle, Hume, and Kant; four days of parliamentary debate during the
  French Revolution; and branching comment trees on the discussion website
  Reddit. In the philosophical and parliamentary cases, the model parameters
  that describe this balance converge under coarse-graining to limit regions
  that demonstrate the emergence of large-scale structure, a result which is
  robust to translation between languages. Meanwhile, we find that the
  political forum we consider on Reddit exhibits a debate-like pattern, while
  communities dedicated to the discussion of science and news show much less
  temporal order, and may make use of the emergent, tree-like topology of
  comment replies to structure their epistemic explorations. Our model allows
  us to quantify the ways in which social technologies such as parliamentary
  procedures and online commenting systems shape the joint exploration of
  ideas.%

    This book provides an overview of two hundred years of German economic
  thought, from the Steetswissenschaften of the eighteenth century to National
  Socialism and the Social Market. Whereas Classical Economics, from Smith
  through Ricardo, to Marx and Mill, emphasised value, distribution and
  production, German economic thought had a long-running tradition of human
  need and the varying conditions for order. These ideas are brought together
  by a conception of rational action and, therefore, a rationalistic appraisal
  of welfare and order. By taking this perspective, the usual contrast of
  market and planning approaches to economic organisation is subsumed by an
  approach which focuses on the construction of order in economic processes.
  This book highlights the continuity of this practical approach of German
  economists through the two centuries under consideration - from the
  Cameralists to the Ordoliberals.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    It was only in the sixteenth century that texts began to refer to the
  significance of "economic activity" -- of sustaining life. This was not
  because the ordinary business of life was thought unimportant, but because
  the principles governing economic conduct were thought to be obvious or
  uncontroversial. The subsequent development of economic writing thus
  parallels the development of capitalism in Western Europe. From the
  seventeenth to the twenty-first century there has been a constant shift in
  content, audience, and form of argument as the literature of economic
  argument developed. The Economy of the Word proposes that to understand the
  various forms that economic literature has taken, we need to adopt a more
  literary approach in economics specifically, to adopt the instruments and
  techniques of philology. This way we can conceive the history of economic
  thought to be an on-going work in progress, rather than the story of the
  emergence of modern economic thinking. This approach demands that we pay
  attention to the construction of particular texts, showing the work of
  economic argument in different contexts. In sum, we need to pay attention to
  the "economy of the word".The Economy of the Word is divided into three
  parts. The first explains what the term "economy" has meant from Antiquity to
  Modernity, coupling this conceptual history with an examination of how the
  idea of national income was turned into a number during the first half of the
  twentieth century. The second part is devoted to Adam Smith's Wealth of
  Nations, considering first the manner in which Smith deals with international
  trade, and then the way in which the book was read in the course of the
  nineteenth century. Part {III} examines the sources used by Karl Marx and
  Léon Walras in developing their economic analysis, drawing attention to
  their shared intellectual context in French political economy.%

    This is a critical bibliography of Adam Smith. It takes as its starting
  point the Vanderblue Collection of Smithiana held by the Kress Library and
  its accompanying published catalogue. This bibliography updates the
  catalogue, which only had a very limited original circulation. The problem
  with Adam Smith is not one of attribution but the re-shaping of his work by
  the accompanying commentary and notes or the effect of translation and
  abridgement. This critical bibliography hopes to bring order to this process.
  A listing of all editions with details of their salient points gives an
  overview of the critical work on Smith as a leading member of the Scottish
  Enlightenment.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In Karl Marx's early writing (first made available many years after his
  death) his economic interpretation of history and his concept of communism
  were set in a comprehensive philosophical framework. Marx's main
  preoccupation at this time was with man estranged from himself in an
  alienated world: a subjective, almost religious theme. Taking full account of
  these earlier writings, Robert Tucker critiques and reinterprets Marx's
  thought. He shows how its origins can be located in earlier German
  philosophers, in particular Kant, Hegel and Feuerbach. Reconstructing the
  genesis of Marxism in its founder's own mind, he clarifies Marx's mystifying
  contention that Marxism represented Hegelianism turned 'on its head'. He then
  presents a new interpretation, based on close textual analysis, of the
  relation between Marx's early philosophical system and the subsequent
  materialist conception of history as expounded in the later and best known
  writings of Marx and Engels. Against this background, Tucker presents Das
  Kapital as a work belonging to the post-Hegelian mythical development of
  Germany philosophy. Considering in turn the genesis of Marxism and the
  underlying continuity of his thought from the early writings to Das Kapital,
  Tucker shows the theme of alienation is central throughout. In the years
  since the book was first written, comments and criticism have encouraged
  Tucker to change his position somewhat. This is explained in a new
  introduction that goes beyond the interpretative enterprise of the rest of
  the book to assess Marx in relation to contemporary concerns: first it
  presents a critique of Marx's treatment of alienation and then it comments on
  the moot problem of the continuing relevance of his social and economic
  thought. On the latter point his views have matured and altered during the
  intervening years and he now finds the economic and social aspects of Marx's
  thought considerably more relevant than he did before.%

    Marx’s Grundrisse is acknowledged as the vital link between Marx’s
  early and late work. It is also a crucial text in elucidating Marx’s debt
  to the idealist philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. This book, first published in 1988,
  is the first full-length study of that relationship, in a thorough textual
  analysis which makes the connections explicit and also the Grundrisse’s
  relations to the works of Adam Smith and Aristotle. This book argues that
  Marx’s critique of political economy, and his critique of Hegel, are double
  interrelated. Not only did Marx adapt Hegelian logic in order to analyse the
  economic categories crucial to modern society but it is argued that those
  logical categories were themselves seen as reflections of the productive
  processes of contemporary commercial society. Uchida reveals a conceptual
  structure common to the apparently rarefied world of Hegelian conceptual
  logic and to the supposedly common-sensical world of economic science.
  Demonstrating this is a considerable achievement, and it allows us to
  consider precisely what is valuable today in Marx’s critical commentary on
  this conceptual structure and on the type of society in which it is
  manifested. Uchida’s subject, like Marx’s, is ‘the force of capital on
  modern life’.%

    More than half a century of cross-cultural research has demonstrated
  group-level differences in psychological and behavioral phenomena, from
  values to attention to neural responses. However, cultures are not static,
  with several specific changes documented for cultural products, practices,
  and values. How and why do societies change? Here we juxtapose theory and
  insights from cultural evolution and social ecology. Evolutionary approaches
  enable an understanding of the how of cultural change, suggesting
  transmission mechanisms by which the contents of culture may change.
  Ecological approaches provide insights into the why of cultural change: They
  identify specific environmental pressures, which evoke shifts in psychology
  and thereby enable greater precision in predictions of specific cultural
  changes based on changes in ecological conditions. Complementary insights
  from the ecological and cultural evolutionary approaches can jointly clarify
  the process by which cultures change. We end by discussing the relevance of
  cultural change research for the contemporary societal shifts and by
  highlighting several critical challenges and future directions for the
  emerging field of cross-temporal research on culture and psychology.%

    Karl Marx is one of the most influential writers in history. Despite
  repeated obituaries proclaiming the death of Marxism, in the 21st century
  Marx's ideas and theories continue to guide vibrant research traditions in
  sociology, economics, political science, philosophy, history, anthropology,
  management, economic geography, ecology, literary criticism, and media
  studies. Due to the exceptionally wide influence and reach of Marxist theory,
  including over 150 years of historical debates and traditions within Marxism,
  finding a point of entry can be daunting. The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx
  provides an entry point for those new to Marxism. At the same time, its
  chapters, written by leading Marxist scholars, advance Marxist theory and
  research. Its coverage is more comprehensive than previous volumes on Marx in
  terms of both foundational concepts and state-of-the-art empirical research
  on contemporary social problems. It is also provides equal space to
  sociologists, economists, and political scientists, with substantial
  contributions from philosophers, historians, and geographers. The Oxford
  Handbook of Karl Marx consists of six sections. The first section,
  Foundations, includes chapters that cover the foundational concepts and
  theories that constitute the core of Marx's theories of history, society, and
  political economy. This section demonstrates that the core elements of Marx's
  political economy of capitalism continue to be defended, elaborated, and
  applied to empirical social science and covers historical materialism, class,
  capital, labor, value, crisis, ideology, and alienation. Additional sections
  include Labor, Class, and Social Divisions; Capitalist States and Spaces;
  Accumulation, Crisis, and Class Struggle in the Core Countries; Accumulation,
  Crisis, and Class Struggle in the Peripheral and Semi-Peripheral Countries;
  and Alternatives to Capitalism.%

    A new aspect of low-intensity conflict can be seen today in El Salvador,
  where the decade-long insurgency appears able to continue without aid from
  traditional sources in Cuba and East Europe. The Farabundo Marti National
  Liberation Front ({FMLN}) made its debut in 1980, but not before a private
  support network was established in the U.S. and other western countries to
  provide funds and political support for its struggle to overthrow the
  Salvadoran government. The {FMLN} is the most sophisticated guerrilla force
  in Latin American history. Raising millions of dollars, the {FMLN} relies on
  a well-oiled propaganda machine run by American supporters to pressure
  Congress to weaken the Salvadoran government. Utilizing front groups,
  churches, and public figures, the {FMLN}'s private network has stymied
  policymakers in Washington and San Salvador. This book illuminates this new
  dimension of low-intensity conflict that will confound the U.S. and its
  allies in the decade to come.%

    Debate and deliberation play essential roles in politics and government,
  but most models presume that debates are won mainly via superior style or
  agenda control. Ideally, however, debates would be won on the merits, as a
  function of which side has the stronger arguments. We propose a predictive
  model of debate that estimates the effects of linguistic features and the
  latent persuasive strengths of different topics, as well as the interactions
  between the two. Using a dataset of 118 Oxford-style debates, our model's
  combination of content (as latent topics) and style (as linguistic features)
  allows us to predict audience-adjudicated winners with 74\% accuracy,
  significantly outperforming linguistic features alone (66\%). Our model finds
  that winning sides employ stronger arguments, and allows us to identify the
  linguistic features associated with strong or weak arguments.%

    Feuerbach is now recognized as a central figure in the history of
  nineteenth-century thought. He was one of Hegel's most influential pupils: he
  dominated German radical philosophy in the 1840s and was the leader of the
  Young Hegelians; his 'anthropological' critique of Hegel's idealism
  decisively influences the materialism and humanism of Marx and Engels; his
  critique of religion pointed the way for the philosophers of religion; and
  his psychological analyses found a place in Freudian thought and the
  existential and phenomenological traditions. In this 1977 text, Professor
  Wartofsky wishes to go beyond this conventional view to establish Feuerbach
  as much more than a transitional figure between Hegel and Marx or an
  influence on important later developments. He seriously considers Feuerbach's
  philosophy on its own terms and seeks to demonstrate its continuing
  importance. He therefore traces Feuerbach's development in detail,
  emphasizing its dialectical character, and finds fundamental originality in
  his epistemology.%

    In this paper, we introduce personalized word embeddings, and examine their
  value for language modeling. We compare the performance of our proposed
  prediction model when using personalized versus generic word representations,
  and study how these representations can be leveraged for improved
  performance. We provide insight into what types of words can be more
  accurately predicted when building personalized models. Our results show that
  a subset of words belonging to specific psycholinguistic categories tend to
  vary more in their representations across users and that combining generic
  and personalized word embeddings yields the best performance, with a 4.7\%
  relative reduction in perplexity. Additionally, we show that a language model
  using personalized word embeddings can be effectively used for authorship
  attribution.%

    In vivid detail, Francis Wheen tells the story of Das Kapital and Karl
  Marx’s twenty-year struggle to complete his unfinished masterpiece. Born in
  a two-room flat in London’s Soho amid political squabbles and personal
  tragedy, the first volume of Das Kapital was published in 1867, to muted
  praise. But after Marx’s death, the book went on to influence thinkers,
  writers, and revolutionaries, from George Bernard Shaw to V. I. Lenin,
  changing the direction of twentieth-century history. Wheen’s captivating,
  accessible book shows that, far from being a dry economic treatise, Das
  Kapital is like a vast Gothic novel whose heroes are enslaved by the monster
  they created: capitalism. Furthermore, Wheen argues, as long as capitalism
  endures, Das Kapital demands to be read and understood.%

    Marx and Russia is a chronological account of the evolution of Marxist
  thought from the publication of Das Kapital in Russian translation to the
  suppression of independent ideological currents by Stalin at the end of the
  1920s. The book demonstrates the progressive emergence of different schools
  of Marxist thinking in the revolutionary era in Russia.Starting from Marx's
  own connections with Russian revolutionaries and scholars, James D. White
  examines the contributions of such figures as Sieber, Plekhanov, Lenin,
  Bogdanov, Trotsky, Bukharin and Stalin to Marxist ideology in Russia. Using
  primary documents, biographical sketches and a helpful timeline, the book
  provides a useful guide for students to orientate themselves among the
  various Marxist ideologies which they encounter in modern Russian history.
  White also incorporates valuable new research for Russian history specialists
  in a vital volume for anyone interested in the history of Marxism, Soviet
  history and the history of Russia across the modern period.%

    Text has always been an important data source in political science. What
  has changed in recent years is the feasibility of investigating large amounts
  of text quantitatively. The internet provides political scientists with more
  data than their mentors could have imagined, and the research community is
  providing accessible text analysis software packages, along with training and
  support. As a result, text-as-data research is becoming mainstream in
  political science. Scholars are tapping new data sources, they are employing
  more diverse methods, and they are becoming critical consumers of findings
  based on those methods. In this article, we first describe the four stages of
  a typical text-as-data project. We then review recent political science
  applications and explore one important methodological challenge—topic model
  instability—in greater detail.%

    Modeling what makes a request persuasive—eliciting the desired response
  from a reader—is critical to the study of propaganda, behavioral economics,
  and advertising. Yet current models can’t quantify the persuasiveness of
  requests or extract successful persuasive strategies. Building on theories of
  persuasion, we propose a neural network to quantify persuasiveness and
  identify the persuasive strategies in advocacy requests. Our semi-supervised
  hierarchical neural network model is supervised by the number of people
  persuaded to take actions and partially supervised at the sentence level with
  human-labeled rhetorical strategies. Our method outperforms several
  baselines, uncovers persuasive strategies—offering increased
  interpretability of persuasive speech—and has applications for other
  situations with document-level supervision but only partial sentence
  supervision.%

    In our world with full of uncertainty, debates and argumentation contribute
  to the progress of science and society. Despite of the increasing attention
  to characterize human arguments, most progress made so far focus on the
  debate outcome, largely ignoring the dynamic patterns in argumentation
  processes. This paper presents a study that automatically analyzes the key
  factors in argument persuasiveness, beyond simply predicting who will
  persuade whom. Specifically, we propose a novel neural model that is able to
  dynamically track the changes of latent topics and discourse in argumentative
  conversations, allowing the investigation of their roles in influencing the
  outcomes of persuasion. Extensive experiments have been conducted on
  argumentative conversations on both social media and supreme court. The
  results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in
  identifying persuasive arguments via explicitly exploring dynamic factors of
  topic and discourse. We further analyze the effects of topics and discourse
  on persuasiveness, and find that they are both useful — topics provide
  concrete evidence while superior discourse styles may bias participants,
  especially in social media arguments. In addition, we draw some findings from
  our empirical results, which will help people better engage in future
  persuasive conversations.%

    Semantic annotation technologies support the extraction of legal concepts,
  for example rights and obligations, from legal documents. For software
  engineers, the final goal is to identify compliance requirements a software
  system has to fulfill in order to comply with a law or regulation. That
  implies analyzing and annotating legal documents in prescriptive natural
  language, still an open problem for research in the field. In this paper we
  describe {GaiusT} 2.0, a system for extracting requirements from legal
  documents. {GaiusT} 2.0 is the result of the evolution of {GaiusT}, and has
  been designed and implemented as a web-based system intended to semi-automate
  the extraction process. Results of the application of {GaiusT} 2.0 show that
  the new version improves performance of the extraction process and also makes
  the tool more usable.%
