    \field{abstract}{%
    In Marx at the Margins, Kevin Anderson uncovers a variety of extensive but
  neglected texts by the well-known political economist which cast what we
  thought we knew about his work in a startlingly different light. Analyzing a
  variety of Marx’s writings, including journalistic work written for the New
  York Tribune, Anderson presents us with a Marx quite at odds with our
  conventional interpretations. Rather than providing us with an account of
  Marx as an exclusively class-based thinker, Anderson here offers a portrait
  of Marx for the twenty-first century: a global theorist whose social critique
  was sensitive to the varieties of human social and historical development,
  including not just class, but nationalism, race, and ethnicity, as well. Marx
  at the Margins ultimately argues that alongside his overarching critique of
  capital, Marx created a theory of history that was multi-layered and not
  easily reduced to a single model of development or revolution. Through
  highly-informed readings on work ranging from Marx’s unpublished 1879–82
  notebooks to his passionate writings about the antislavery cause in the
  United States, this volume delivers a groundbreaking and canon-changing
  vision of Karl Marx that is sure to provoke lively debate in Marxist
  scholarship and beyond.%

    This paper provides a quantitative analysis of the effects of the law and
  economics movement on the U.S. justice system using the universe of opinions
  in U.S. Circuit Courts from 1891 and 1 million District Court criminal
  sentencing decisions linked to judge identity. We use attendance in a
  controversial economics training program that 40\% of federal judges attended
  by 1990, a policy change giving judges more sentencing discretion, random
  assignment of judges to control for court- and case-level factors, an
  exogenous seating network from random panel composition to trace the spread
  of economic reasoning in law, and ordering of cases within Circuit to
  identify memetic economic ideas that move across legal topics. We find that
  judges who use law and economics language vote for and author conservative
  verdicts in economics cases and are more opposed to government regulation and
  criminal appeals. After attending Henry Manne's economics training program,
  judges use more economics language and render conservative verdicts in
  economics cases and reject criminal appeals, and this result is robust to a
  large set of judge biographical controls. Manne economics training is more
  predictive of these decisions than political party. Manne judges render 20\%
  harsher (10 months longer) criminal sentences after U.S. v. Booker allowed
  more sentencing discretion. They also impact criminal appeals verdicts when
  not authoring the opinion. Judges exposed to Manne peers increase their use
  of economics language in subsequent opinions. Ideas such as “optimal
  deterrence”, “capital”, and “law and economics” move across legal
  topics.%

    How did the French Revolution become thinkable? Keith Michael Baker, a
  leading authority on the ideological origins of the French Revolution,
  explores this question in his wide-ranging collection of essays. Analyzing
  the new politics of contestation that transformed the traditional political
  culture of the Old Regime during its last decades, Baker revises our
  historical map of the political space in which the French Revolution took
  form. Some essays study the ways in which the revolutionaries' break with the
  past was prepared by competition between agents and critics of absolute
  monarchy to control the cultural resources and political meanings of French
  sought before 1789 to reconstitute their body politic; and by the invention
  of 'public opinion' as a new form of political authority displacing notions
  of 'representation', 'constitution', 'sovereignty' - and of 'the French
  Revolution' itself - the ambiguities, tensions, and contradictions that were
  to drive the revolutionary dynamic in subsequent years. The result is a
  substantial and unified set of studies, stimulating renewed reflection on one
  of the central themes in modern European history.%

    Statism and Anarchy is a complete English translation of the last work by
  the great Russian anarchist Michael Bakunin. It was written in 1873, in the
  aftermath of the rise of the German Empire and the clash between Bakunin and
  Karl Marx in the first International. Bakunin assesses the strength of a
  European state system dominated by Bismarck. Then, in the most remarkable
  part of the book, he assails the Marxist alternative, predicting that a
  "dictatorship of the proletariat" will in fact be a dictatorship over the
  proletariat, and will produce a new class of socialist rulers. Instead, he
  outlines his vision of an anarchist society and identifies the social forces
  he believes will achieve an ananarchist revolution. Statism and Anarchy had
  an immediate influence on the "to the people" movement of Russian populism,
  and Bakunin's ideas inspired other anarchist movements. This is the only
  complete and reliable rendition of Statism and Anarchy in English, and in a
  lucid introduction Marshall Shatz locates Bakunin in his immediate historical
  and intellectual context, and assesses the impact of his ideas on the wider
  development of European radical thought. A guide to further reading and a
  chronology of events are appended as aids to students encountering Bakunin's
  thought for the first time.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    The French Revolution brought principles of “liberty, equality,
  fraternity” to bear on the day-to-day challenges of governing what was then
  the largest country in Europe. Its experiments provided a model for future
  revolutions and democracies across the globe, but this first modern
  revolution had no model to follow. Using reconstructed transcripts of debates
  held in the Revolution’s first parliament, we present a quantitative
  analysis of how this body managed innovation. We use information theory to
  track the creation, transmission, and destruction of word-use patterns across
  over 40,000 speeches and a thousand speakers. The parliament as a whole was
  biased toward the adoption of new patterns, but speakers’ individual
  qualities could break these overall trends. Speakers on the left innovated at
  higher rates, while speakers on the right acted to preserve prior patterns.
  Key players such as Robespierre (on the left) and Abbé Maury (on the right)
  played information-processing roles emblematic of their politics. Newly
  created organizational functions—such as the Assembly president and
  committee chairs—had significant effects on debate outcomes, and a distinct
  transition appears midway through the parliament when committees, external to
  the debate process, gained new powers to “propose and dispose.” Taken
  together, these quantitative results align with existing qualitative
  interpretations, but also reveal crucial information-processing dynamics that
  have hitherto been overlooked. Great orators had the public’s attention,
  but deputies (mostly on the political left) who mastered the committee system
  gained new powers to shape revolutionary legislation.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    This article analyzes Martin Luther’s role in spreading the early
  Reformation, one of the most important episodes of radical institutional
  change in the last millennium. We argue that social relations played a key
  role in its diffusion because the spread of heterodox ideologies and their
  eventual institutionalization relied not only on private “infection”
  through exposure to innovation but also on active conversion and promotion of
  that new faith through personal ties. We conceive of that process as
  leader-to-follower directional influence originating with Luther and flowing
  to local elites through personal ties. Based on novel data on Luther’s
  correspondence, Luther’s visits, and student enrollments in Luther’s city
  of Wittenberg, we reconstruct Luther’s influence network to examine whether
  local connections to him increased the odds of adopting Protestantism. Using
  regression analyses and simulations based on empirical network data, we find

    Histories of German philosophy in the nineteenth century typically focus on
  its first half—when Hegel, idealism, and Romanticism dominated. By
  contrast, the remainder of the century, after Hegel's death, has been
  relatively neglected because it has been seen as a period of stagnation and
  decline. But Frederick Beiser argues that the second half of the century was
  in fact one of the most revolutionary periods in modern philosophy because
  the nature of philosophy itself was up for grabs and the very absence of
  certainty led to creativity and the start of a new era. In this innovative
  concise history of German philosophy from 1840 to 1900, Beiser focuses not on
  themes or individual thinkers but rather on the period’s five great
  debates: the identity crisis of philosophy, the materialism controversy, the
  methods and limits of history, the pessimism controversy, and the
  Ignorabimusstreit. Schopenhauer and Wilhelm Dilthey play important roles in
  these controversies but so do many neglected figures, including Ludwig
  Büchner, Eugen Dühring, Eduard von Hartmann, Julius Fraunstaedt, Hermann
  Lotze, Adolf Trendelenburg, and two women, Agnes Taubert and Olga Pluemacher,
  who have been completely forgotten in histories of philosophy. The result is
  a wide-ranging, original, and surprising new account of German philosophy in
  the critical period between Hegel and the twentieth century.%

    Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their
  self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence
  length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an
  attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy
  to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer's attention
  mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and
  combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention.
  Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we evaluate Longformer on
  character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on
  text8 and enwik8. In contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer
  and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our pretrained Longformer
  consistently outperforms {RoBERTa} on long document tasks and sets new
  state-of-the-art results on {WikiHop} and {TriviaQA}. We finally introduce
  the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder ({LED}), a Longformer variant for supporting
  long document generative sequence-to-sequence tasks, and demonstrate its
  effectiveness on the {arXiv} summarization dataset.%

    First published over fifty years ago, Isaiah Berlin's compelling portrait
  of the father of socialism has long been considered a classic of modern
  scholarship and the best short account written of Marx's life and thought. It
  provides a penetrating, lucid, and comprehensive introduction to Marx as
  theorist of the socialist revolution, illuminating his personality and ideas,
  and concentrating on those which have historically formed the central core of
  Marxism as a theory and practice. Berlin goes on to present an account of
  Marx's life as one of the most influential and incendiary social philosophers
  of the twentieth century and depicts the social and political atmosphere in
  which Marx wrote. This edition includes a new introduction by Alan Ryan which
  traces the place of Berlin's Marx from its pre-World War {II} publication to
  the present, and elucidates why Berlin's portrait, in the midst of voluminous
  writings about Marx, remains the classic account of the personal and
  political side of this monumental figure.%

    A justification is offered for approaching classic works of political
  theory as relevant to problems that concern us. Perennial problems are shown
  to exist in three increasingly controversial senses. First, past authors
  addressed a problem which we can ponder. Second, past authors addressed a
  problem which authors who wrote on these authors also addressed and which we
  can ponder. Third, numerous authors expressed beliefs relevant to a problem
  which we can ponder. The errors identified by opponents of perennial problems
  arise from empirical misjudgements concerning the ways that different authors
  addressed such problems, not from the assumption that such problems exist.%

    This is the first major study of Marx and the Young Hegelians in twenty
  years. The book offers a new interpretation of Marx's early development, the
  political dimension of Young Hegelianism, and that movement's relationship to
  political and intellectual currents in early nineteenth-century Germany.
  Warren Breckman challenges the orthodox distinction drawn between the
  exclusively religious concerns of Hegelians in the 1830s and the
  sociopolitical preoccupations of the 1840s. He shows that there are
  inextricable connections between the theological, political and social
  discourses of the Hegelians in the 1830s. The book draws together an account
  of major figures such as Feuerbach and Marx, with discussions of lesser-known
  but significant figures such as Eduard Gans, August Cieszkowski, Moses Hess,
  F.W.J. Schelling as well as such movements as French Saint-Simonianism and
  'positive philosophy'. Wide-ranging in scope and synthetic in approach, this
  is an important book for historians of philosophy, theology, political theory
  and nineteenth-century ideas.%

    Friedrich Nietzsche was immensely influential and, counter to most
  expectations, also very well read. An essential new reference tool for those
  interested in his thinking, Nietzsche’s Philosophical Context identifies
  the chronology and huge range of philosophical books that engaged him.
  Rigorously examining the scope of this reading, Thomas H. Brobjer consulted
  over two thousand volumes in Nietzsche’s personal library, as well as his
  book bills, library records, journals, letters, and publications. This
  meticulous investigation also considers many of the annotations in his books.
  In arguing that Nietzsche’s reading often constituted the starting point
  for, or counterpoint to, much of his own thinking and writing, Brobjer’s
  study provides scholars with fresh insight into how Nietzsche worked and
  thought; to which questions and thinkers he responded; and by which of them
  he was influenced. The result is a new and much more contextual understanding
  of Nietzsche's life and thinking.%

    Marx was a highly original and polymathic thinker, unhampered by
  disciplinary boundaries, whose intellectual influence has been enormous. Yet
  in the wake of the collapse of Marxism-Leninism in Eastern Europe the
  question arises as to how important his work really is for us now. An
  important dimension of this volume is to place Marx's writings in their
  historical context and to separate what he actually said from what others (in
  particular, Engels) interpreted him as saying. Informed by current debates
  and new perspectives, the volume provides a comprehensive coverage of all the
  major areas to which Marx made significant contributions.%

    The German Ideology as a 'book' dates only from the early 1920s and 1930s.
  The opening 'chapter' 'I. Feuerbach' was factitiously constructed to solve
  the problem posed by Marx's engimatic reference in 1859 to
  'self-clarification'. This was in autobiographical passages detailing his
  'outlook', termed by Engels the 'materialist interpretation of history'.
  Factual evidence presented here makes this framing untenable. 'The German
  ideology' manuscript materials of 1845–6 are best studied — not as a
  'smooth text' of the 'last hand' — but as a 'variant-rich' text that allows
  access to a 'laboratory' where Marx and Engels were learning to think as they
  did.%

    This book examines the life and works of Friedrich Engels during the decade
  before he entered a political partnership with Karl Marx. It takes a thematic
  approach in three substantial chapters: Imagination, Observation, and
  Vocation. Throughout, the reader sees the world from Engels’s perspective,
  not knowing how his story will turn out. This approach reveals the
  multifaceted and ambitious character of young Friedrich’s achievements from
  age sixteen till just turning twenty-five. At the time that he accepted
  Marx’s invitation to co-author a short political satire, Engels was far
  better known and much more accomplished. He had published many more articles
  on far more subjects, in both German and English, than Marx had managed.
  Moreover, he had written a critique of political economy from a perspective
  unique in the German context, and published his own pioneering and
  substantial study of working class conditions in an industrializing economy.
  Offering an innovative approach to a largely neglected period of Engels’s
  life before meeting Marx, Carver upends standard narratives in existing
  biographical studies of Engels to reveal him as an important figure not just
  in relation to his more famous collaborator, but a key voice in the
  liberal-democratic, constitutional and nation-building revolutionism of the
  1830s and 1840s.%

    Reknowned historian Roger Chartier, one of the most brilliant and
  productive of the younger generation of French writers and scholars now at
  work refashioning the Annales tradition, attempts in this book to analyze the
  causes of the French revolution not simply by investigating its “cultural
  origins” but by pinpointing the conditions that “made is possible because
  conceivable.”Chartier has set himself two important tasks. First, while
  acknowledging the seminal contribution of Daniel Mornet’s Les origens
  intellectuelles de la Révolution française (1935), he synthesizes the
  half-century of scholarship that has created a sociology of culture for
  Revolutionary France, from education reform through widely circulated printed
  literature to popular expectations of government and society. Chartier goes
  beyond Mornet’s work, not be revising that classic text but by raising
  questions that would not have occurred to its author.Chartier’s second
  contribution is to reexamine the conventional wisdom that there is a
  necessary link between the profound cultural transformation of the eighteenth
  century (generally characterized as the Enlightenment) and the abrupt
  Revolutionary rupture of 1789. The Cultural Origins of the French Revolution
  is a major work by one of the leading scholars in the field and is likely to
  set the intellectual agenda for future work on the subject.%

    A new biography of Karl Marx, tracing the life of this titanic figure and
  the legacy of his work Karl Marx remains the most influential and
  controversial political thinker in history. He died quietly in 1883 and a
  mere eleven mourners attended his funeral, but a year later he was being
  hailed as "the Prophet himself" whose name and writings would "endure through
  the ages." He has been viewed as a philosopher, economist, historian,
  sociologist, political theorist, even a literary craftsman. But who was Marx?
  What informed his critiques of modern society? And how are we to understand
  his legacy? In Marx and Marxism, Gregory Claeys, a leading historian of
  socialism, offers a wide-ranging, accessible account of Marx's ideas and
  their development, from the nineteenth century through the Russian Revolution
  to the present. After the collapse of the Soviet Union his reputation seemed
  utterly eclipsed, but now a new generation is reading and discovering Marx in
  the wake of the recurrent financial crises, growing social inequality, and an
  increasing sense of the injustice and destructiveness of capitalism. Both his
  critique of capitalism and his vision of the future speak across the
  centuries to our times, even if the questions he poses are more difficult to
  answer than ever.%

    The nineteenth century was seemingly a period of great progress. Huge
  advancements and achievements were made in science, technology and industry
  that transformed life and work alike. But a growing pride in modernity and
  innovation was tainted by a sense of the loss of the past and the multiple
  threats which novelty posed. The Cambridge Companion to Nineteenth-Century
  Thought provides an impressive survey of the period's major ideas and trends.
  Leading scholars explore some of the most influential concepts and debates
  within philosophy, history, political thought, economics, religion and the
  social sciences, as well as feminism and imperialism. Some of these debates
  continued into the following century and many still remain relevant in the
  present day. This Companion is an excellent tool for readers seeking to
  understand the genesis of modern discourse across a range of humanities and
  social science subjects.%

    The method of interpreting political theory in relation to its specific
  historical contexts offers particular insight into the work of Karl Marx.
  When pre-capitalist societies are understood in relation to Marx's rigorously
  conceived capitalist mode of production, it is apparent that the context in
  which Marx produced his very earliest work was itself pre-capitalist. It can
  then be recognized that Marx began by making a significant contribution to an
  existing framework of critical political theory but also that, following a
  critical confrontation with English political economy in 1844, he opened new
  avenues of thought in relation to a new context: capitalism.%

    This book considers Karl Marx’s ideas in relation to the social and
  political context in which he lived and wrote. It emphasizes both the
  continuity of his commitment to the cause of full human emancipation, and the
  role of his critique of political economy in conceiving history to be the
  history of class struggles. The book follows his developing ideas from before
  he encountered political economy, through the politics of 1848 and the
  Bonapartist “farce,”, the maturation of the critique of political economy
  in the Grundrisse and Capital, and his engagement with the politics of the
  First International and the legacy of the Paris Commune. Notwithstanding
  errors in historical judgment largely reflecting the influence of dominant
  liberal historiography, Marx laid the foundations for a new social theory
  premised upon the historical consequences of alienation and the potential for
  human freedom.%

    We introduce a new language representation model called {BERT}, which
  stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike
  recent language representation models, {BERT} is designed to pre-train deep
  bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on
  both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained
  {BERT} model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to
  create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question
  answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific
  architecture modifications. {BERT} is conceptually simple and empirically
  powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language
  processing tasks, including pushing the {GLUE} score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point
  absolute improvement), {MultiNLI} accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute
  improvement), {SQuAD} v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point
  absolute improvement) and {SQuAD} v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute

    In this third volume of his definitive study of Karl Marx's political

  of dictatorship in relation to the revolutionary use of force and repression,
  particularly as this debate has centered on the use of the term "dictatorship
  of the proletariat." Writing with his usual wit and perception, Draper strips
  away the layers of misinterpretation and misinformation that have accumulated
  over the years to show what Marx and Engels themselves really meant by the
  term.%

    The First Socialist Schism chronicles the conflicts in the International
  Working Men's Association (the First International, 1864-1877), which
  represents an important milestone in the history of political ideas and
  socialist theory. In defending their autonomy, federations in the
  International became aware of what separated them from the social democratic
  movement that relied on the establishment of national labor parties and the
  conquest of political power. This can be seen as a decisive moment in the
  history of political ideas: the split between centralist party politics and
  the federalist grassroots movement. The separate movements in the
  International--which would later develop into social democracy, communism,
  and anarchism--found their greatest advocates in Mikhail Bakunin and Karl
  Marx. However, the significance of this alleged clash of titans is largely a
  modern invention. It was not the rivalry between two arch-enemies or a
  personal vendetta based on mutual resentment that made the conflict between
  Bakunin and Marx so important but rather that it heralded the first socialist
  schism between parliamentary party politics aiming to conquer political power
  and social-revolutionary concepts. Instead of focusing exclusively on what
  Marx and Bakunin said, many other contributions to this debate are examined,
  making this the first reconstruction of a dispute that gripped the entire
  organization. This book also provides the first detailed account of the
  International's Congress of The Hague (September, 1872); including the
  background, the sequence of events, and international reaction. The book sets
  new standards when it comes to source material, taking into account documents
  from numerous archives and libraries that have previously gone unnoticed or
  were completely unknown.%

    News editorials argue about political issues in order to challenge or
  reinforce the stance of readers with different ideologies. Previous research
  has investigated such persuasive effects for argumentative content. In
  contrast, this paper studies how important the style of news editorials is to
  achieve persuasion. To this end, we first compare content- and style-oriented
  classifiers on editorials from the liberal {NYTimes} with ideology-specific
  effect annotations. We find that conservative readers are resistant to
  {NYTimes} style, but on liberals, style even has more impact than content.
  Focusing on liberals, we then cluster the leads, bodies, and endings of
  editorials, in order to learn about writing style patterns of effective
  argumentation.%

    A systematic, critical examination of Karl Marx's social theories and their
  philosophical presuppositions. Through extensive discussions of the texts Jon
  Elster offers a balanced and detailed account of Marx's views that is at once
  sympathetic, undogmatic and rigorous. Equally importantly he tries to assess
  'what is living and what is dead in the philosophy of Marx', using the
  analytical resources of contemporary social science and philosophy. Professor
  Elster insists on the need for microfoundations in social science and
  provides a systematic criticism of functionalism and teleological thinking in
  Marx. He argues that Marx's economic theories are largely wrong or
  irrelevant; historical materialism is seen to have only limited plausibility
  (and is not even consistently applied by Marx); Marx's most lasting
  achievements are the criticism of capitalism in terms of alienation and
  exploitation and the theory of class struggle, politics and ideology under
  capitalism, though in these areas too Elster enters substantial
  qualifications. The book should take its place as the most comprehensive and
  sophisticated modern study available.%

    More of the social world lives within electronic text than ever before,
  from collective activity on the web, social media, and instant messaging to
  online transactions, government intelligence, and digitized libraries. This
  supply of text has elicited demand for natural language processing and
  machine learning tools to filter, search, and translate text into valuable
  data. We survey some of the most exciting computational approaches to text
  analysis, highlighting both supervised methods that extend old theories to
  new data and unsupervised techniques that discover hidden regularities worth
  theorizing. We then review recent research that uses these tools to develop
  social insight by exploring (a) collective attention and reasoning through
  the content of communication; (b) social relationships through the process of
  communication; and (c) social states, roles, and moves identified through
  heterogeneous signals within communication. We highlight social questions for
  which these advances could offer powerful new insight.%

    Marx's first, flawed, attempt at a critique of political economy has
  received little attention. This paper reviews the evidence for Marx's
  knowledge of political economy before his reception of Engels' Umrisse; his
  economic reading in the Paris period; and the arguments of the first
  manuscript of the {EPM} itself, showing the absence of Ricardo and the
  pervasive use of Smith's Wealth of Nations, in particular, the division of
  labour, the rent theory, the subsistence wage, and the three states of
  society. The material on estranged labour was envisaged by Marx as an
  explanation of the capitalist economic system superior to that offered by the
  political economists. But his subsequent reading of Ricardo's Principles
  leads Marx to discard the economics of the {EPM}.%

    This book is a reception study of Karl Marx’s and Friedrich Engels’
  ideas in Britain during the late nineteenth century and a revisionist account
  of the emergence of modern British socialism. It reconstructs how H. M.
  Hyndman, E. B. Bax, and William Morris interacted with Marx and
  ‘Marxism’. It shows how Hyndman was a socialist of liberal and republican
  provenance, rather than the Tory radical he is typically held to be; how Bax
  was a sophisticated thinker and highly influential figure in European
  socialist circles, rather than a negligible pedant; and it shows how
  Morris’s debt to Bax and liberalism has not been given its due. It
  demonstrates how John Stuart Mill, in particular, was combined with Marx in
  Britain; it illuminates other liberal influences which help to explain the
  sectarian attitude adopted by the Social Democratic Federation towards
  organised labour; and it establishes an alternative genealogy for Fabian
  socialism.%

    Brilliantly researched and wonderfully written, Love and Capital reveals
  the rarely glimpsed and heartbreakingly human side of the man whose works
  would redefine the world after his death.Drawing upon previously unpublished
  material, acclaimed biographer Mary Gabriel tells the story of Karl and Jenny
  Marx's marriage. Through it, we see Karl as never before: a devoted father
  and husband, a prankster who loved a party, a dreadful procrastinator,
  freeloader, and man of wild enthusiasms -- one of which would almost destroy
  his marriage. Through years of desperate struggle, Jenny's love for Karl
  would be tested again and again as she waited for him to finish his
  masterpiece, Capital.An epic narrative that stretches over decades to recount
  Karl and Jenny's story against the backdrop of Europe's Nineteenth Century,
  Love {andCapital} is a surprising and magisterial account of romance and
  revolution -- and of one of the great love stories of all time.%

    Assessing scholarly influence is critical for understanding the collective
  system of scholarship and the history of academic inquiry. Influence is
  multifaceted, and citations reveal only part of it. Citation counts exhibit
  preferential attachment and follow a rigid “news cycle” that can miss
  sustained and indirect forms of influence. Building on dynamic topic models
  that track distributional shifts in discourse over time, we introduce a
  variant that incorporates features, such as authorship, affiliation, and
  publication venue, to assess how these contexts interact with content to
  shape future scholarship. We perform in-depth analyses on collections of
  physics research (500,000 abstracts; 102 years) and scholarship generally
  ({JSTOR} repository: 2 million full-text articles; 130 years). Our measure of
  document influence helps predict citations and shows how outcomes, such as
  winning a Nobel Prize or affiliation with a highly ranked institution, boost
  influence. Analysis of citations alongside discursive influence reveals that
  citations tend to credit authors who persist in their fields over time and
  discount credit for works that are influential over many topics or are
  “ahead of their time.” In this way, our measures provide a way to
  acknowledge diverse contributions that take longer and travel farther to
  achieve scholarly appreciation, enabling us to correct citation biases and
  enhance sensitivity to the full spectrum of scholarly impact.%

    In the first major reinterpretation of the French Enlightenment in twenty
  years, Dena Goodman moves beyond the traditional approach to the
  Enlightenment as a chapter in Western intellectual history and examines its
  deeper significance as cultural history. She finds the very epicenter of the
  Enlightenment in a community of discourse known as the Republic of Letters,
  where salons governed by women advanced the Enlightenment project "to change
  the common way of thinking." Goodman details the history of the Republic of
  Letters in the Parisian salons, where men and women, philosophes and
  salonnieres, together not only introduced reciprocity into intellectual life
  through the practices of letter writing and polite conversation but also
  developed a republican model of government that was to challenge the
  monarchy. Providing a new understanding of women's importance in the
  Enlightenment, Goodman demonstrates that in the Republic of Letters men and
  women played complementary - and unequal - roles. Salonnieres governed the
  Republic of Letters by enforcing rules of polite conversation that made
  possible a discourse characterized by liberty and civility. Goodman
  chronicles the story of the Republic of Letters from its earliest formation
  through major periods of change: the production of the Encyclopedia, the
  proliferation of a print culture that widened circles of readership beyond
  the control of salon governance, and the early years of the French
  Revolution. Although the legacy of the Republic of Letters remained a force
  in French cultural and political life, in the 1780s men formed new
  intellectual institutions that asserted their ability to govern themselves
  and that marginalized women. {TheRepublic} of Letters introduces provocative
  explanations both for the failure of the Enlightenment and for the role of
  the Enlightenment in the French Revolution.%

    This book reconstructs how a group of nineteenth-century labor reformers
  appropriated and radicalized the republican tradition. These "labor
  republicans" derived their definition of freedom from a long tradition of
  political theory dating back to the classical republics. In this tradition,
  to be free is to be independent of anyone else's will - to be dependent is to
  be a slave. Borrowing these ideas, labor republicans argued that wage
  laborers were unfree because of their abject dependence on their employers.
  Workers in a cooperative, on the other hand, were considered free because
  they equally and collectively controlled their work. Although these labor
  republicans are relatively unknown, this book details their unique,
  contemporary, and valuable perspective on both American history and the
  organization of the economy.%

    Politics and political conflict often occur in the written and spoken word.
  Scholars have long recognized this, but the massive costs of analyzing even
  moderately sized collections of texts have hindered their use in political
  science research. Here lies the promise of automated text analysis: it
  substantially reduces the costs of analyzing large collections of text. We
  provide a guide to this exciting new area of research and show how, in many
  instances, the methods have already obtained part of their promise. But there
  are pitfalls to using automated methods–they are no substitute for careful
  thought and close reading and require extensive and problem-specific
  validation. We survey a wide range of new methods, provide guidance on how to
  validate the output of the models, and clarify misconceptions and errors in
  the literature. To conclude, we argue that for automated text methods to
  become a standard tool for political scientists, methodologists must
  contribute new methods and new methods of validation.%

    Since the latest crisis of capitalism broke out in 2008, Marx has been back
  in fashion, and sometimes it seems that his ideas have never been as topical,
  or as commanding of respect and interest, as they are today. This edited
  collection arises from one of the largest international conferences dedicated
  to the bicentenary of Marx’s birth. The volume contains 16 chapters
  authored by globally renowned scholars and is divided into two parts: I) On
  the Critique of Politics; {II}) On the Critique of Political Economy. These
  contributions, from multiple academic disciplines, offer diverse perspectives
  on why Marx is still so relevant for our times and make this book a source of
  great appeal for both expert scholars of Marx as well as students and general
  readers who are approaching his theories for the first time.%

    In Marx, Capital, and the Madness of Economic Reason, David
  Harvey-Capital's greatest expositor-explains one of the most important
  political and economic texts of the nineteenth century in readily
  understandable terms.Karl Marx's Capital is one of the most important texts
  written in the modern era. Since 1867, when the first of its three volumes
  was published, it has had a profound effect on politics and economics in
  theory and practice throughout the world. But Marx wrote in the context of
  capitalism in thesecond half of the nineteenth century: his assumptions and
  analysis need to be updated in order to address to the technological,
  economic, and industrial change that has followed Capital's initial
  publication.In Marx, Capital, and the Madness of Economic Reason, David
  Harvey not only provides a concise distillation of his famous course on
  Capital, but also makes the text relevant to the twenty-first century's
  continued processes of globalization. Harvey shows the work's continuing
  analytical power, doingso in the clearest and simplest terms but never
  compromising its depth and complexity.Marx, Capital, and the Madness of
  Economic Reason provides an accessible window into Harvey's unique approach
  to Marxism and takes readers on a riveting roller coaster ride through recent
  global history. It demonstrates how and why Capital remains a living,
  breathing document with an outsizedinfluence on contemporary social thought.%

    The global economic crisis and recession that began in 2008 had at least
  one unexpected outcome: a surge in sales of Karl Marx's Capital. Although
  mainstream economists and commentators once dismissed Marx's work as outmoded
  and flawed, some are begrudgingly acknowledging an analysis that sees
  capitalism as inherently unstable. And of course, there are those, like
  Michael Heinrich, who have seen the value of Marx all along, and are in a
  unique position to explain the intricacies of Marx's thought.Heinrich's
  modern interpretation of Capital is now available to English-speaking readers
  for the first time. It has gone through nine editions in Germany, is the
  standard work for Marxist study groups, and is used widely in German
  universities. The author systematically covers all three volumes of Capital
  and explains all the basic aspects of Marx's critique of capitalism in a way
  that is clear and concise. He provides background information on the
  intellectual and political milieu in which Marx worked, and looks at crucial
  issues beyond the scope of Capital, such as class struggle, the relationship
  between capital and the state, accusations of historical determinism, and
  Marx's understanding of communism. Uniquely, Heinrich emphasizes the monetary
  character of Marx's work, in addition to the traditional emphasis on the
  labor theory of value, this highlighting the relevance of Capital to the age
  of financial explosions and implosions.%

    For over a century, Karl Marx’s critique of capitalism has been a crucial
  resource for social movements. Now, recent economic crises have made it
  imperative for us to comprehend and actualize Marx’s ideas. But without a
  knowledge of Karl Marx’s life as he lived it, neither Marx nor his works
  can be fully understood. There are more than twenty-five comprehensive
  biographies of Marx, but none of them consider his life and work in equal,
  corresponding measure. This biography, planned for three volumes, aims to
  include what most biographies have reduced to mere background: the
  contemporary conflicts, struggles, and disputes that engaged Marx at the time
  of his writings, alongside his complex relationships with a varied assortment
  of friends and opponents. This first volume will deal extensively with
  Marx’s youth in Trier and his studies in Bonn and Berlin. It will also
  examine the function of poetry in his intellectual development and his first
  occupation with Hegelian philosophy and with the so-called “young
  Hegelians” in his 1841 Dissertation. Already during this period, there were
  crises as well as breaks in Marx’s intellectual development that prompted
  Marx to give up projects and re-conceptualize his critical enterprise. This
  volume is the beginning of an astoundingly dimensional look at Karl Marx –
  a study of a complex life and body of work through the neglected issues,
  events, and people that helped comprise both. It is destined to become a
  classic.%

    The first and best, major treatment of the crucial years 1848-1875, a
  penetrating analysis of the rise of capitalism throught the world.In the
  1860s a new word entered the economic and political vocabulary of the world:
  'capitalism'. The global triumph of capitalism is the major theme of history
  in the decades after 1848. It was the triumph of a society which believed
  that economic growth rests on competitive private enterprise, on success in
  buying everything in the cheapest market (including labour) and selling it in
  the dearest. An economy so based, and therefore nestling naturally on the
  sound foundations of a bourgoisie composed of those whom energy, merit and
  intelligence had raised to their position and kept there, would - it was
  believed - not only create a world of suitably distributed material plenty
  but of ever-growing enlightenment, reason and human opportunity, an advance
  of the sciences and the arts, in brief a world of continuous and accelerating
  material and moral progress.%

    "Written with brio, warmth, and historical understanding, this is the best
  biography of one of the most attractive inhabitants of Victorian England,
  Marx's friend, partner, and political heir."—Eric {HobsbawmFriedrich}
  Engels is one of the most intriguing and contradictory figures of the
  nineteenth century. Born to a prosperous mercantile family, he spent his life
  enjoying the comfortable existence of a Victorian gentleman; yet he was at
  the same time the co-author of The Communist Manifesto, a ruthless political
  tactician, and the man who sacrificed his best years so that Karl Marx could
  have the freedom to write. Although his contributions are frequently
  overlooked, Engels's grasp of global capital provided an indispensable
  foundation for communist doctrine, and his account of the Industrial
  Revolution, The Condition of the Working Class in England, remains one of the
  most haunting and brutal indictments of capitalism's human cost.Drawing on a
  wealth of letters and archives, acclaimed historian Tristram Hunt plumbs
  Engels's intellectual legacy and shows us how one of the great bon viveurs of
  Victorian Britain reconciled his exuberant personal life with his radical
  political philosophy. This epic story of devoted friendship, class
  compromise, ideological struggle, and family betrayal at last brings Engels
  out from the shadow of his famous friend and collaborator.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    By the start of the Victorian period the school of British economists
  acknowledging Adam Smith as its master was in the ascendancy. 'Political
  Economy', a catch-all title which ignored the diversity of viewpoints to be
  found amongst the discipline's leading proponents, became associated in the
  popular mind with moral and political forces held to be uniquely conducive to
  the progress of an increasingly industrialised and competitive society.
  'Political Economy' served in turn as the focus for critics of equally
  diverse moral and political persuasions, who sought to challenge the
  materialism of contemporary society and offer their own assessments of the
  profound social changes of the time. In the introductory essay to the
  collection of readings from such 'critics of capitalism', the editors review
  the principles of the early economists, the way in which these principles
  were appropriated and applied by their Victorian successors and the
  contrasting modes which critics of popular economic ideas assumed. Subsequent
  extracts from the writings of the Owenite Socialist John Bray, Carlyle, Marx
  and Engels, J. S. Mill, Ruskin, Arnold, T. H. Green, William Morris and G. B.
  Shaw, demonstrate both the breadth of the possible grounds for ideological
  opposition to the prevailing philosophy and the shifting nature of the debate
  as 'Political Economy' itself was revealed as incapable of explaining or
  responding to the changing conditions of the 1870s. Headnotes to the extracts
  describe the genesis of individual debate and discuss distinctive stylistic
  features. Annotation in the form of footnotes and endnotes has been designed
  to gloss obscure allusions and arguments. In making more accessible the
  socio-economic writings of those authors now better known for their
  imaginative work, this volume will enable readers to reach a more profound
  appreciation of the central role such work played in developing the moral
  vision embodied in their more lastingly popular books and essays.%

    This article reexamines Marx's early conception of history by returning to
  his 1845–6 manuscripts, long known as The German Ideology. On conventional
  interpretations of these manuscripts, Marx sought to explain the entire
  historical process through a theory of the systematic development of
  productive forces. This article reveals that concern to be an artifact of
  subsequent editorial practices and argues that a different concern animated
  the manuscripts for Marx himself—namely to grasp the nature of individual
  epochs, particularly the present one, which he doubted that a generalized
  theory of history could help him to do. In “Saint Max,” perhaps the most
  neglected of these early manuscripts, Marx developed the concept of a “mode
  of production” into a historical lens, one that could aid the work of
  social critique by bringing into focus how the present is made and might be
  made anew.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    In 1980 Alvin Gouldner identified two traditions of Marxist
  thought--Marxism as science and Marxism as critique. This book is concerned
  with the first and by far the most politically influential of those
  traditions--Marxism as science. It analyzes the claim, first made by Marx and
  Engels themselves, that Marxism is some kind of hard natural science of
  society able to identify laws of social development and to provide a
  scientific guide to revolutionary activity. Marxism and Science breaks new
  ground by using Wittgensteinian analysis of Marxist discourse to construct a
  totally different conception of Marxism appropriate to the postmodern world.
  In this conception, Marxism is a point of view that can be advanced,
  rationally defended, and made convincing and persuasive to others, but that
  is as partial in some respects as any other political point of view.
  Reconceiving Marxism thus requires not only understanding language in a
  different nonobjectivist way but also adopting a new political practice and
  program, which the book proceeds to outline. Marxism and Science concludes
  that, intellectually, Marxism as hard science is fairly obviously and
  profoundly untenable. But it goes on to argue that the purely intellectual
  grounds for this claim are much less interesting than the political and
  psychological purposes that such a claim has always served for Marxists in
  particular and scientific socialists in general. The most important of these
  purposes has been to provide a sort of psychological and emotional certitude
  to set against the overwhelming existential domination of capitalism in the
  world. Claiming this certitude to be as spurious as the arguments used to
  sustain it, the author calls upon Marxists and socialists to admit this and
  accept the doubt and uncertainty that come with a frank avowal of an open and
  unforeclosed future.%

    We argue word embedding models are a useful tool for the study of culture
  using a historical analysis of shared understandings of social class as an
  empirical case. Word embeddings represent semantic relations between words as
  relationships between vectors in a high-dimensional space, specifying a
  relational model of meaning consistent with contemporary theories of culture.
  Dimensions induced by word differences (rich – poor) in these spaces
  correspond to dimensions of cultural meaning, and the projection of words
  onto these dimensions reflects widely shared associations, which we validate
  with surveys. Analyzing text from millions of books published over 100 years,
  we show that the markers of class continuously shifted amidst the economic
  transformations of the twentieth century, yet the basic cultural dimensions
  of class remained remarkably stable. The notable exception is education,
  which became tightly linked to affluence independent of its association with
  cultivated taste.%

    The great French Marxist philosopher weighs up the contributions of the
  three major critics of {modernityWith} the translation of Lefebvre's
  philosophical writings, his stature in the English-speaking world continues
  to grow. Though certainly within the Marxist tradition, he consistently saw
  Marx as an 'unavoidable, necessary, but insufficient starting point'.
  Unsurprisingly, Lefebvre always insisted on the importance of Hegel to
  understanding Marx. But the imposing Metaphilosophy also suggested the
  significance he ascribed to Nietzsche, in the 'realm of shadows' through
  which philosophy seeks to think the world. Lefebvre proposes here that the
  modern world is at the same time Hegelian in terms of the state; Marxist in
  terms of the social and society; and Nietzschean in terms of civilization and
  its values. As early as 1939, Lefebvre pioneered a French reading of
  Nietzsche that rejected the philosopher's appropriation by fascism, bringing
  out the tragic implications of Nietzsche's proclamation that 'God is dead'
  long before this approach was followed by such later writers as Foucault,
  Derrida and Deleuze. Forty years later, in the last of his philosophical
  writings, Lefebvre juxtaposes the contributions of the three great thinkers,
  in a text whose themes remain surprisingly relevant today.%

  that the republic would be a bourgeois republic, which would subject the
  proletariat to the capitalist. He attacked republicans for neglecting social
  depredation in favour of political reform. However, his transition to
  communism also carried with it several republican commitments. Unlike the
  many apolitical versions of communism at the time, Marx insisted that the
  workers had to establish the republic before communism could emerge. He also
  extended key republican political ideas, including the objection to arbitrary
  power, to the social sphere. But what was absent was an account of a more
  participatory and accountable political alternative to the modern
  republic.{\textless}/p{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}However, the
  experience of ordinary workers carrying out the legislative and public
  administration of Paris during the Commune, led Marx to return to many of
  those early republican themes. He celebrated ordinary citizens' capacity for
  self-government and advocated popular control over the state and transforming
  representative democracy into popular delegacy. He came to realise that these
  political structures were essential to achieving the social goals of
  communism. He thus came to a synthesis of his early republicanism and later
  communism.%

    Republicanism is a powerful resource for emancipatory struggles against
  domination. Its commitment to popular sovereignty subverts justifications of
  authority, locating power in the hands of the citizenry who hold the capacity
  to create, transform, and maintain their political institutions.
  Republicanism's conception of freedom rejects social, political, and economic
  structures subordinating citizens to any uncontrolled power - from capitalism
  and wage-labour to patriarchy and imperialism. It views any such domination
  as inimical to republican freedom. Moreover, it combines a revolutionary
  commitment to overturning despotic and tyrannical regimes with the creation
  of political and economic institutions that realise the sovereignty of all
  citizens, institutions that are resilient to threats of oligarchical control.
  This volume is dedicated to retrieving and developing this radical potential,
  challenging the more conventional moderate conceptions of republicanism. It
  brings together scholars at the forefront of tracing this radical heritage of
  the republican tradition, and developing arguments, texts, and practices into
  a critical and emancipatory body of political and social thought. The volume
  spans historical discussions of the English Levellers, French and Ottoman
  revolutionaries, and American abolitionists and trade unionists; explorations
  of the radical republican aspects of the thought of Machiavelli, Marx, and
  Rousseau; and theoretical examinations of social domination and popular
  constitutionalism. It will appeal to political theorists, historians of
  political thought, and political activists interested in how republicanism
  provides a robust and successful radical transformation to existing social
  and political orders.%

    The Young Karl Marx is an innovative and important study of Marx's early
  writings. These writings provide the fascinating spectacle of a powerful and
  imaginative intellect wrestling with complex and significant issues, but they
  also present formidable interpretative obstacles to modern readers. David
  Leopold shows how an understanding of their intellectual and cultural context
  can illuminate the political dimension of these works. An erudite yet
  accessible discussion of Marx's influences and targets frames the author's
  critical engagement with Marx's account of the emergence, character, and
  (future) replacement of the modern state. This combination of historical and
  analytical approaches results in a sympathetic, but not uncritical,
  exploration of such fundamental themes as alienation, citizenship, community,
  anti-semitism, and utopianism. The Young Karl Marx is a scholarly and
  original work which provides a radical and persuasive reinterpretation of
  Marx's complex and often misunderstood views of German philosophy, modern
  politics, and human flourishing.%

    Divergent Paths is the first volume of a groundbreaking three-volume work.
  Its purpose is to explore the relationship between Hegel and Marx; to define
  the relationship between Hegel and Engels; and to distinguish between the
  theories of Marxism and Engelsism. Marx used Feuerbach towards the critique
  and ultimate transformation of Hegel's phenomenology and humanism. This
  transformation, which cut out Hegel's idealism by identifying the environment
  in which people produced their sustenance as the subject of history, marks
  the genesis of historical materialism. Marx continued to use Hegel's logical
  categories. In chapter three of Divergent Paths, Norman Levine conducts an in
  depth study of Marx's 1841 doctoral dissertation, The Difference Between
  Democritus' and Epicurus' Philosophy of Nature. It is the center of gravity
  and controversy of Levine's study. Placed alongside Hegel's Philosophy of
  History, Levine isolates the categories Marx appropriated from Hegel to show,
  conclusively, that Marx was not a dialectical materialist. Levine then claims
  that Engels totally distorted the Hegelian legacy, and this debasement is
  enshrined in his 1887 essay 'Ludwig Feuerbach and The End of Classical German
  Philosophy.' Levine brilliantly locates Marxism as the theory of Marx, and
  Engelsism the theory of Engels. According to Levine both embodied a separate
  view of history and society, and their contradictions are expressive, in
  part, of their divergent receptions of Hegel. This is an analysis like no
  other published to date with two more volumes planned. Philosophers,
  sociologists, anthropologists and historiographers of Marx and Engels cannot
  afford to miss this study.%

    "This book seeks to show how Karl Marx's vision of communism was a
  continuation of Aristotle's classical humanist philosophy. Challenging the
  Engelsian distortion of Marx, it presents a negation of previous
  interpretations of Marx which present him in materialist terms. Engels
  proposed a picture of the highest stage of communist society as an economic
  egalitarianism, a vision which became an axiom of Leninist-Stalinist-Soviet
  Communism. By contrast, here it is shown that Marx embraced the Aristotelian
  concept of "distributive justice", of proportionate equality. Spanning the
  works of Marx, from his university education and doctoral dissertation on the
  differences between the Democritean and Epicurean philosophy of the atom, to
  the study of his Rheinische Zeitung period and the persistence of classical
  humanism in Marx's defense of the freedom of the press, Levine skillfully
  reveals the gravitational pull between Marx and Aristotle. Showing how
  classical humanism is the dominant ethos in the communism of Marx, the book
  includes chapters on: Hegel as a transition point between Aristotle and Marx;
  The links between Marx's theory of labor and Aristotle's idea of the
  constitutive subject located in The Politics; How the local methodologies of
  Aristotle and Hegel provided Marx with the social methodologies by which to
  interpret the functioning of capitalism. Marx's Resurrection of Aristotle is
  the culmination of Norman Levine's life-long work to establish the correct
  placement of Marx and Marx's communism within the classical humanist
  tradition"--%

    In the late eighteen-seventies, the German Social Democratic Party, while
  still healing the wounds of old battles between Lassalleans and Eisenachers,
  was confronted by foes who delivered attacks on two levels. On the one level,
  Bismarck and his supporters fought energetically to annihilate the party with
  the passage of the Socialist Law (October 21, 1878). After some initial
  faltering steps, the Social Democrats found a firm footing and struggled
  successfully to preserve their political existence. The movement was
  preserved, even though the party organization, its affiliates and its
  newspapers were suppressed. On another level, the Social Democrats faced an
  ideological challenge. Their political suppression broadly paralleled the
  emergence of a conservative socialism which flourished for a short time in a
  variety of forms. Whatever clothing it wore, conservative socialism aimed to
  undermine the growing appeal of Social Democracy to the working-men of
  Germany. A theory of State Socialism was the most attractive garment designed
  by conservative social thought. The response of the Social Democratic Party
  to the various facets of this conservative socialism is a significant chapter
  in the history of the German socialist movement.%

    The globalised world of the twenty-first century has many parallels with
  that of the period running up to the cataclysm of 1914, namely the world
  predicted by Karl Marx. Communications go that much faster, but this is a
  difference of degree, not type. People, messages, and ideas are flung around
  the globe. Money circulates in a never-ceasing torrent, poverty lives side by
  side with wealth, and capital exercises its impersonal power over each and
  every one of us. In this world, Karl Marx blunt and straightforward enough to
  inspire criticism of the latest exploits of capitalism, the failings of
  politics, and the genuflection of those in power before fetishes like The
  Market ' lives on. Despite nearly 200 years having passed since his birth,
  his burning condemnation of capitalism remains of immediate interest today.
  The texts he left behind gave rise to what would come to be called Marxism,
  but that was a term he rejected. His approach enormous amounts of reading and
  writing, integrating new discoveries from the various sciences into his
  analyses of society was a far cry from how his theories would come to be used
  in states where only one, party-approved interpretation was allowed. Now,
  more than ever before, these texts can be read for what they truly are. In
  addition to providing a living picture of Marx the man, his life, and his
  family and friends as well as his lifelong collaboration with Friedrich
  Engels Sweden 's leading intellectual historian Sven-Eric Liedman, in this
  major new biography, shows what Karl Marx the thinker and researcher really
  wrote, demonstrating that this giant of the nineteenth century can still
  exert a powerful attraction for the inhabitants of the twenty-first.%

    Recent work on the history of political thought, exploiting digital
  resources, is challenging the idea that empirically and hermeneutically
  minded political scientists must work independently in silos. Work by
  students of the Cambridge School and work by textual data miners are showing
  the way toward a new hermeneutical circle—one in which empirically and
  hermeneutically minded political scientists can use digital resources to
  analyze diverse texts and make groundbreaking discoveries on relationships
  between textual uses of language and political change. I analyze this new
  trend toward different sorts of political scientists using digital resources
  to study ideas, to outline underlying paradigms relating language and
  politics in these respective fields, and to consider how they could be
  brought into productive conversation. I then consider how such conversation
  would enrich subdisciplinary understandings of the role of language in
  politics. Ultimately, I use this analysis to generate a broader model for how
  empirically and hermeneutically inclined political scientists can benefit

    \field{abstract}{%
    One reader has called this study, first published in 1984, ‘easily the
  best book on the relation of Hegel to Marx’. With spirited argument,
  {MacGregor} demonstrates that Hegelian logic suited Marx’s purpose so well
  because it already contained the unique elements that later appeared in
  Marx’s social theory, including the notions of surplus value and the
  transition to communism. The most exciting thing about the book is the clear
  demonstration that the mature Marx gets ever closer to Hegel, and is
  increasingly indebted to him. In short, the author gives us a new Hegel and a
  new Marx. In a manner both original and penetrating, {MacGregor} shows that
  dialectical logic is pre-eminently social logic, a reconstruction in thought
  of social relationships and social structure. Central to the work is the
  examination of the Philosophy of Right, in which Hegel delineated a theory of
  modern capitalist society. {MacGregor} provides a compelling analysis of
  Hegel’s importance for Lenin and a strong caveat that contemporary Marxism
  ignores Hegel to its own peril. {MacGregor} establishes that Hegel’s
  absolute idealism is founded on a theory of the dialectics of labour similar
  to Marx’s historical materialism. Another significant discovery elucidates
  Hegel’s concept of poverty as the missing link which joins Marx’s
  formulation to classical liberal theory.%

    Today, Karl Marx is considered one of the preeminent social scientists of
  the last two centuries, and ranks among the most frequently assigned authors
  in university syllabi. However in Marx’s time, many competing sociological
  traditions and socialist political movements espoused similar ideas from
  different origin points. How did Marx emerge as preeminent? We hypothesize
  that the 1917 Russian Revolution is responsible for elevating Marx’s fame
  and intellectual following above his contemporary competitors. Using the
  synthetic control method and Google Ngram data, we construct a synthetic
  counterfactual for Marx’s citation patterns. This allows us to predict how
  often Marx would have been cited if the Russian Revolution had not happened.
  We find a significant treatment effect, meaning that Marx’s intellectual
  influence may be partly due to political accidents.%

    A clear and compact guide to Marx’s road to Das Kapital Ernest Mandel
  traces the development of Marx’s economic ideas from the Economic and
  Philosophical Manuscripts to the completion of the Grundrisse. In a series of
  crystalline chapters, he provides an overview of subjects central to Marxist
  economic theory. Mandel focuses on Marx’s concept of alienation, which
  gained much currency among Marxists in the twentieth century, and traces the
  development of debates surrounding the labour theory of value, and Marx’s
  writings on communism and “crisis.” These discussions remain pertinent
  today, and these texts vital to all those who wish to interpret and to change

    The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efficient method
  for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a
  large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this
  paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the
  vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we
  obtain significant speedup and also learn more regular word representations.
  We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called
  negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their
  indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic
  phrases. For example, the meanings of "Canada" and "Air" cannot be easily
  combined to obtain "Air Canada". Motivated by this example, we present a
  simple method for finding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector
  representations for millions of phrases is possible.%

    The period leading up to the Revolutions of 1848 was a seminal moment in
  the history of political thought, demarcating the ideological currents and
  defining the problems of freedom and social cohesion which are among the key
  issues of modern politics. This 2006 anthology offers research on Hegel's
  followers in the 1830s and 1840s. With essays by philosophers, political
  scientists, and historians from Europe and North America, it pays special
  attention to questions of state power, the economy, poverty, and labour, as
  well as to ideas on freedom. The book examines the political and social
  thought of Eduard Gans, Ludwig Feuerbach, Max Stirner, Bruno and Edgar Bauer,
  the young Engels, and Marx. It places them in the context of Hegel's
  philosophy, the Enlightenment, Kant, the French Revolution,
  industrialization, and urban poverty. It also views Marx and Engels in
  relation to their contemporaries and interlocutors in the Hegelian school.%

  the history of political and social thought. They raised questions of
  democracy, nationhood, freedom and social cohesion that have remained among
  the key issues of modern politics, and still help to define the major
  ideological currents - liberalism, socialism, republicanism, anarchism,
  conservatism - in which these questions continue to be debated today. This
  collection of essays by internationally prominent historians of political
  thought examines the 1848 Revolutions in a pan-European perspective, and
  offers research on questions of state power, nationality, religion, the
  economy, poverty, labour, and freedom. Even where the revolutionary movements
  failed to achieve their explicit objectives of transforming the state and
  social relations, they set the agenda for subsequent regimes, and contributed
  to the shaping of modern European thought and institutions.%

    Written between 1857 and 1858, the Grundrisse is the first draft of Marx's
  critique of political economy and, thus, also the initial preparatory work on
  Capital. Despite its editorial vicissitudes and late publication, Grundrisse
  contains numerous reflections on matters that Marx did not develop elsewhere
  in his oeuvre and is therefore extremely important for an overall
  interpretation of his thought. In this collection, various international
  experts in the field, analysing the Grundrisse on the 150th anniversary of
  its composition, present a Marx in many ways radically different from the one
  who figures in the dominant currents of twentieth-century Marxism. The book
  demonstrates the relevance of the Grundrisse to an understanding of Capital
  and of Marx's theoretical project as a whole, which, as is well known,
  remained uncompleted. It also highlights the continuing explanatory power of
  Marxian categories for contemporary society and its present contradictions.
  With contributions from such scholars as Eric Hobsbawm and Terrell Carver,
  and covering subject areas such as political economy, philosophy and Marxism,
  this book is likely to become required reading for serious scholars of Marx
  across the world.%

    Following the break-up of the Soviet Union, Marx was regarded as a thinker
  doomed to oblivion about whom everything had already been said and written.
  However, the international economic crisis of 2008 favoured a return to his
  analysis of capitalism, and recently published volumes of the
  Marx-Engels-Gesamtausgabe ({MEGA}2) have provided researchers with new texts
  that underline the gulf between Marx's critical theory and the dogmatism of
  many twentieth-century Marxisms. This work reconstructs with great textual
  and historical rigour, but in a form accessible to those encountering Marx
  for the first time, a number of little noted, or often misunderstood, stages
  in his intellectual biography. The book is divided into three parts. The
  first – 'Intellectual Influences and Early Writings' – investigates the
  formation of the young Marx and the composition of his Parisian manuscripts
  of 1844. The second – 'The Critique of Political Economy' – focuses on
  the genesis of Marx's magnum opus, beginning with his studies of political
  economy in the early 1850s and following his labours through to all the
  preparatory manuscripts for Capital. The third – 'Political Militancy' –
  presents an insightful history of the International Working Men's Association
  and of the role that Marx played in that organization. The volume offers a
  close and innovative examination of Marx's ideas on post-Hegelian philosophy,
  alienated labour, the materialist conception of history, research methods,
  the theory of surplus-value, working-class self-emancipation, political
  organization and revolutionary theory. From this emerges “another Marx”,
  a thinker very different from the one depicted by so many of his critics and
  ostensible disciples.%

    Faced with a new crisis of capitalism, many scholars are now looking back
  to the author whose ideas were too hastily dismissed after the fall of the
  Berlin Wall. During the last decade, Marx’s Capital has received renewed
  academic and popular attention. It has been reprinted in new editions
  throughout the world and the contemporary relevance of its pages is being
  discussed again. Today, Marx’s analyses are arguably resonating even more
  strongly than they did in his own time and Capital continues to provide an
  effective framework to understand the nature of capitalism and its
  transformations. This volume includes the proceedings of the biggest
  international conference held in the world to celebrate the 150th anniversary
  of Capital’s publication. The book is divided into three parts: I)
  "Capitalism, Past and Present"; {II}) "Extending the Critique of Capital";
  {III}) "The Politics of Capital". It contains the contributions of globally
  renowned scholars from 13 countries and multiple academic disciplines who
  offer diverse perspectives, and critical insights into the principal
  contradictions of contemporary capitalism while pointing to alternative
  economic and social models. Together, they reconsider the most influential
  historical debates on Capital and provide new interpretations of Marx’s
  magnum opus in light of themes rarely associated with Capital, such as
  gender, ecology, and non-European societies. The book is an indispensable
  source for academic communities who are increasingly interested in
  rediscovering Marx beyond 20th century Marxism. Moreover, it will be of great
  appeal to students, as well as established scholars interested in critique of
  capitalism and socialist theory.%

    An innovative reassessment of the last writings and final years of Karl
  Marx. In the last years of his life, Karl Marx expanded his research in new
  directions—studying recent anthropological discoveries, analyzing communal
  forms of ownership in precapitalist societies, supporting the populist
  movement in Russia, and expressing critiques of colonial oppression in India,
  Ireland, Algeria, and Egypt. Between 1881 and 1883, he also traveled beyond
  Europe for the first and only time. Focusing on these last years of Marx's
  life, this book dispels two key misrepresentations of his work: that Marx
  ceased to write late in life, and that he was a Eurocentric and economic
  thinker fixated on class conflict alone. With The Last Years of Karl Marx,
  Marcello Musto claims a renewed relevance for the late work of Marx,
  highlighting unpublished or previously neglected writings, many of which
  remain unavailable in English. Readers are invited to reconsider Marx's
  critique of European colonialism, his ideas on non-Western societies, and his
  theories on the possibility of revolution in noncapitalist countries. From
  Marx's late manuscripts, notebooks, and letters emerge an author markedly
  different from the one represented by many of his contemporary critics and
  followers alike. As Marx currently experiences a significant rediscovery,
  this volume fills a gap in the popularly accepted biography and suggests an
  innovative reassessment of some of his key concepts.%

    "The alienation of humankind, in the fundamental sense of the term, means
  the loss of control: its embodiment in an alien force which confronts the
  individuals as a hostile and potentially destructive power. When Marx
  analysed alienation in his Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 1844, he
  indicated four principal aspects of it - the alienation of human beings from:
  (1) nature ; (2) their own productive activity ; (3) their 'species being',
  as members of the human species; and (4) each other. He forcefully underlined
  that all this is not some 'fatality of nature' - as indeed as the structural
  antagonisms of capital are characteristically misrepresented, so as to leave
  them in their place - but a form of self-alienation. In other words, not the
  deed of an all-powerful outside agency, natural or metaphysical, but the
  outcome of a determinate type of historical development which can be
  positively altered by a conscious intervention in the historical process, in
  order to 'transcend labour's self-alienation'."--Preface.%

    Following Converse's advice that ideology is the product of a 'creative
  synthesis,' conducted by a narrow group of intellectuals, this paper reports
  on attempts to study ideology at its point of creation. I develop a measure
  of ideology expressed among pundits, based on coded opinion pieces in
  magazines and newspapers from 1830 to 1990. I use this measure to test the
  impact of ideas on party coalitions. I argue that ideologies, as created by
  intellectuals, strongly influence the coalitions that party leaders advance.
  In three cases the realignment on slavery before the Civil War, the Civil
  Rights realignment in the mid-20th century, and the party change on abortion
  more recently there is evidence that intellectuals reorganize the issues
  before parties realign around them. This evidence suggests that the patterns
  of 'what goes with what' that intellectuals design have an impact on the
  nature of political cleavages.%

    Originally published in 1975, The Machiavellian Moment remains a landmark
  of historical and political thought. Celebrated historian J.G.A. Pocock looks
  at the consequences for modern historical and social consciousness arising
  from the ideal of the classical republic revived by Machiavelli and other
  thinkers of Renaissance Italy. Pocock shows that Machiavelli's prime emphasis
  was on the moment in which the republic confronts the problem of its own
  instability in time, which Pocock calls the "Machiavellian moment."After
  examining this problem in the works of Machiavelli, Guicciardini, and
  Giannotti, Pocock turns to the revival of republican ideology in Puritan
  England and in Revolutionary and Federalist America. He argues that the
  American Revolution can be considered the last great act of civic humanism of
  the Renaissance and he relates the origins of modern historicism to the clash
  between civic, Christian, and commercial values in eighteenth-century
  thought.This Princeton Classics edition of The Machiavellian Moment features
  a new introduction by Richard Whatmore.%

    {BERT} (Devlin et al., 2018) and {RoBERTa} (Liu et al., 2019) has set a new
  state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic
  textual similarity ({STS}). However, it requires that both sentences are fed
  into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the
  most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50
  million inference computations ({\textasciitilde}65 hours) with {BERT}. The
  construction of {BERT} makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as
  well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering. In this publication, we
  present Sentence-{BERT} ({SBERT}), a modification of the pretrained {BERT}
  network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive
  semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using
  cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair
  from 65 hours with {BERT} / {RoBERTa} to about 5 seconds with {SBERT}, while
  maintaining the accuracy from {BERT}. We evaluate {SBERT} and {SRoBERTa} on
  common {STS} tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other
  state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods.%

    Word embeddings, the coefficients from neural network models predicting the
  use of words in context, have now become inescapable in applications
  involving natural language processing. Despite a few studies in political
  science, the potential of this methodology for the analysis of political
  texts has yet to be fully uncovered. This paper introduces models of word
  embeddings augmented with political metadata and trained on large-scale
  parliamentary corpora from Britain, Canada, and the United States. We fit
  these models with indicator variables of the party affiliation of members of
  parliament, which we refer to as party embeddings. We illustrate how these
  embeddings can be used to produce scaling estimates of ideological placement
  and other quantities of interest for political research. To validate the
  methodology, we assess our results against indicators from the Comparative
  Manifestos Project, surveys of experts, and measures based on roll-call
  votes. Our findings suggest that party embeddings are successful at capturing
  latent concepts such as ideology, and the approach provides researchers with
  an integrated framework for studying political language.%

    The present work is aimed at filling a hiatus in the literature dealing
  with the Young Hegelians and the early thought of Karl Marx. Despite the
  prevalent view in the past few decades that Bruno Bauer played an important
  part in the radical activity of Hegel's young disciples in the eighteen
  forties in Germany, no comprehensive work has so far been published on the
  relations between Bauer and Marx. In 1927 Ernst Bar nikol promised to write a
  monograph on the subject, but he never did. For the purpose of this study I
  perused material in numerous library collections and I would like to express
  my gratitude to the staff of the following institutions: Tel Aviv University

  History in Am sterdam, the Heidelberg University Library, the Library of

    For a century now Marxists have been searching for a 'rational kernel' of
  Hegelian 'dialectics' inside the 'mystical shell' of the Hegelian system. As
  against this entire tradition, Rosenthal insists that Hegelian philosophy is
  mysticism all the way through. He argues that Marx's supposed 'dialectic
  method' is simply a myth propagated by academics and proposes the provocative
  thesis that it is not, after all, Hegel's 'method' of which Marx made use in
  Capital but rather precisely Hegel's mysticism. The role of money in Marx and
  Hegel is examined in detail.%

    Comment Marx travaillait-il? La question prend une importance toute

  examen de détail n'a été tenté pour étudier une méthode de travail que
  l'on sait ou devine pourtant toute personnelle, et, plus particulièrement,
  opposée à celle de Hegel. Un critique russe ayant commenté la methode
  dialectique de Marx, celui-ci ajoute à la seconde edition du Capital les

    Marx a lu pendant près de sept ans les ouvrages des économistes et en a

  cahiers. En 1851, il se croit, avec quelque apparence de raison, au bout de
  ses recherches, et s'apprête à rédiger l'oeuvre méditée. L'accueil des
  éditeurs allemands ne l'y encourage guère. Malade, sans ressources, il se
  voit offrir la correspondance européenne d'un grand quotidien new-yorkais et
  accepte avec empressement. Le problème est d'écrire en anglais. Il aura
  recours à Engels et signera les articles que son anti lui enverra pendant
  plusieurs mois de Manchester.%

    This article seeks to contextualize Marx's path to the Capital volumes
  through what might be called its 'international dimension'. It explores how
  Marx experienced an array of differentially developed yet related societies
  through a consciousness of backwardness, and how this consciousness moulded
  his praxis. In this respect, the article takes issue with the Marxist
  assumption that the silence in Capital regarding the multi-linear character
  of modern world development is ultimately non-harmful to the volumes'
  uni-linear notion of modern world development. The aim of the article is
  essentially to clear the way for a more rigorous Historical Materialist
  appreciation of multi-linearity in modern world development. It does so by
  arguing that the condition of multi-linearity in modern world development
  formed the very terrain upon which Marx intellectually journeyed towards
  Capital. Specifically, the framing of the Capital volumes around a singular
  dialectic of social transformation should be considered as the failed outcome
  of Marx's pre-existing engagement with the problem of multi-linearity. This
  argument has ramifications for contemporary Marxist understandings of world
  development, as well as demonstrating the general importance of
  contextualizing political thought through an international rather than
  national or universal historical narrative.%

    Finalist for the Pulitzer Prize (Biography) A New York Times Book Review
  Editors Choice Selection Named one of the Best Books of the Year by
  Publishers Weekly and Book Riot “Absorbing, meticulously researched....
  [Sperber] succeeds in the primary task of all biography, re-creating a man
  who leaps off the page.” —Jonathan Freedland, New York Times Book Review
  In this magisterial biography of Karl Marx, “likely to be definitive for
  many years to come” (John Gray, New York Review of Books), historian
  Jonathan Sperber creates a meticulously researched and multilayered portrait
  of both the man and the revolutionary times in which he lived. Based on
  unprecedented access to the recently opened archives of Marx’s and
  Engels’s complete writings, Karl Marx: A Nineteenth-Century Life provides a
  historical context for the personal story of one of the most influential and
  controversial political philosophers in Western history. By removing Marx
  from the ideological conflicts of the twentieth century that colored his
  legacy and placing him within “the society and intellectual currents of the
  nineteenth century” (Ian Kershaw), Sperber is able to present a full
  portrait of Marx as neither a soothsaying prophet of the modern world nor the
  author of its darkest atrocities. This major biography fundamentally reshapes
  our understanding of a towering historical figure.%

    The years of the first industrial revolution saw a remarkable flowering of
  radical social criticism in Britain. This is a study of the ideas that
  emerged then and of the social and intellectual conditions from which they
  developed. Dr Stafford begins in Part I by presenting what will be seen as a
  very valuable general account of the historical and cultural setting, showing
  how the language of social debate had been affected by intellectual
  developments and the increasingly rapid transformations of society. Then in
  Part {II} he discusses ten major critics of British society, from Thomas
  Spence to William Cobbett, who represent a wide range of political opinion
  from anarchism to Tory radicalism. Dr. Stafford takes a key text by each
  author, sets out its argument, and analyzes it both critically and
  historically, showing the particular influences that shaped it and revealing
  the ways in which the social thought of the time resembles or diverges from
  our own. This book will help to recover from unwarranted neglect this
  important tradition of writing that did much to form subsequent thinking
  about society. It will make a valuable contribution to the study of the
  literature and the social and intellectual history of the period.%

    As much a portrait of his time as a biography of the man, Karl Marx:
  Greatness and Illusion returns the author of Das Kapital to his
  nineteenth-century world, before twentieth-century inventions transformed him
  into Communism's patriarch and fierce lawgiver. Gareth Stedman Jones depicts
  an era dominated by extraordinary challenges and new notions about God, human
  capacities, empires, and political systems--and, above all, the shape of the
  future. In the aftermath of the Battle of Waterloo, a Europe-wide argument
  began about the industrial transformation of England, the Revolution in
  France, and the hopes and fears generated by these occurrences. Would the
  coming age belong to those enthralled by the revolutionary events and ideas
  that had brought this world into being, or would its inheritors be those who
  feared and loathed it? Stedman Jones gives weight not only to Marx's views
  but to the views of those with whom he contended. He shows that Marx was as
  buffeted as anyone else living through a period that both confirmed and
  confounded his interpretations--and that ultimately left him with terrible
  intimations of failure. Karl Marx allows the reader to understand Marx's
  milieu and development, and makes sense of the devastating impact of new ways
  of seeing the world conjured up by Kant, Hegel, Feuerbach, Ricardo,
  Saint-Simon, and others. We come to understand how Marx transformed and
  adapted their philosophies into ideas that would have--through twists and
  turns inconceivable to him--an overwhelming impact across the globe in the
  twentieth century.%

    "All political action has . . . in itself a directedness towards knowledge
  of the good: of the good life, or of the good society. For the good society
  is the complete political good. If this directedness becomes explicit, if men
  make it their explicit goal to acquire knowledge of the good life and of the
  good society, political philosophy emerges. . . . The theme of political
  philosophy is mankind’s great objectives, freedom and government or
  empire—objectives which are capable of lifting all men beyond their poor
  selves. Political philosophy is that branch of philosophy which is closest to
  political life, to non-philosophic life, to human life."—From "What Is
  Political Philosophy?" What Is Political Philosophy?—a collection of ten
  essays and lectures and sixteen book reviews written between 1943 and
  1957—contains some of Leo Strauss’s most famous writings and some of his
  most explicit statements of the themes that made him famous. The title essay
  records Strauss’s sole extended articulation of the meaning of political
  philosophy itself. Other essays discuss the relation of political philosophy
  to history, give an account of the political philosophy of the non-Christian
  Middle Ages and of classic European modernity, and present his theory of
  esoteric writing.%

    It was only in the sixteenth century that texts began to refer to the
  significance of "economic activity" -- of sustaining life. This was not
  because the ordinary business of life was thought unimportant, but because
  the principles governing economic conduct were thought to be obvious or
  uncontroversial. The subsequent development of economic writing thus
  parallels the development of capitalism in Western Europe. From the
  seventeenth to the twenty-first century there has been a constant shift in
  content, audience, and form of argument as the literature of economic
  argument developed. The Economy of the Word proposes that to understand the
  various forms that economic literature has taken, we need to adopt a more
  literary approach in economics specifically, to adopt the instruments and
  techniques of philology. This way we can conceive the history of economic
  thought to be an on-going work in progress, rather than the story of the
  emergence of modern economic thinking. This approach demands that we pay
  attention to the construction of particular texts, showing the work of
  economic argument in different contexts. In sum, we need to pay attention to
  the "economy of the word".The Economy of the Word is divided into three
  parts. The first explains what the term "economy" has meant from Antiquity to
  Modernity, coupling this conceptual history with an examination of how the
  idea of national income was turned into a number during the first half of the
  twentieth century. The second part is devoted to Adam Smith's Wealth of
  Nations, considering first the manner in which Smith deals with international
  trade, and then the way in which the book was read in the course of the
  nineteenth century. Part {III} examines the sources used by Karl Marx and
  Léon Walras in developing their economic analysis, drawing attention to
  their shared intellectual context in French political economy.%

  preoccupation at this time was with man estranged from himself in an
  alienated world: a subjective, almost religious theme. Taking full account of
  these earlier writings, Robert Tucker critiques and reinterprets Marx's
  thought. He shows how its origins can be located in earlier German
  philosophers, in particular Kant, Hegel and Feuerbach. Reconstructing the
  genesis of Marxism in its founder's own mind, he clarifies Marx's mystifying
  contention that Marxism represented Hegelianism turned 'on its head'. He then
  presents a new interpretation, based on close textual analysis, of the
  relation between Marx's early philosophical system and the subsequent
  materialist conception of history as expounded in the later and best known
  writings of Marx and Engels. Against this background, Tucker presents Das
  Kapital as a work belonging to the post-Hegelian mythical development of
  Germany philosophy. Considering in turn the genesis of Marxism and the
  underlying continuity of his thought from the early writings to Das Kapital,
  Tucker shows the theme of alienation is central throughout. In the years
  since the book was first written, comments and criticism have encouraged
  Tucker to change his position somewhat. This is explained in a new
  introduction that goes beyond the interpretative enterprise of the rest of
  the book to assess Marx in relation to contemporary concerns: first it
  presents a critique of Marx's treatment of alienation and then it comments on
  the moot problem of the continuing relevance of his social and economic
  thought. On the latter point his views have matured and altered during the
  intervening years and he now finds the economic and social aspects of Marx's
  thought considerably more relevant than he did before.%

    Marx’s Grundrisse is acknowledged as the vital link between Marx’s
  early and late work. It is also a crucial text in elucidating Marx’s debt
  to the idealist philosopher G.W.F. Hegel. This book, first published in 1988,
  is the first full-length study of that relationship, in a thorough textual
  analysis which makes the connections explicit and also the Grundrisse’s
  relations to the works of Adam Smith and Aristotle. This book argues that
  Marx’s critique of political economy, and his critique of Hegel, are double
  interrelated. Not only did Marx adapt Hegelian logic in order to analyse the
  economic categories crucial to modern society but it is argued that those
  logical categories were themselves seen as reflections of the productive
  processes of contemporary commercial society. Uchida reveals a conceptual
  structure common to the apparently rarefied world of Hegelian conceptual
  logic and to the supposedly common-sensical world of economic science.
  Demonstrating this is a considerable achievement, and it allows us to
  consider precisely what is valuable today in Marx’s critical commentary on
  this conceptual structure and on the type of society in which it is
  manifested. Uchida’s subject, like Marx’s, is ‘the force of capital on
  modern life’.%

    Karl Marx is one of the most influential writers in history. Despite
  repeated obituaries proclaiming the death of Marxism, in the 21st century
  Marx's ideas and theories continue to guide vibrant research traditions in
  sociology, economics, political science, philosophy, history, anthropology,
  management, economic geography, ecology, literary criticism, and media
  studies. Due to the exceptionally wide influence and reach of Marxist theory,
  including over 150 years of historical debates and traditions within Marxism,
  finding a point of entry can be daunting. The Oxford Handbook of Karl Marx
  provides an entry point for those new to Marxism. At the same time, its
  chapters, written by leading Marxist scholars, advance Marxist theory and
  research. Its coverage is more comprehensive than previous volumes on Marx in
  terms of both foundational concepts and state-of-the-art empirical research
  on contemporary social problems. It is also provides equal space to
  sociologists, economists, and political scientists, with substantial
  contributions from philosophers, historians, and geographers. The Oxford
  Handbook of Karl Marx consists of six sections. The first section,
  Foundations, includes chapters that cover the foundational concepts and
  theories that constitute the core of Marx's theories of history, society, and
  political economy. This section demonstrates that the core elements of Marx's
  political economy of capitalism continue to be defended, elaborated, and
  applied to empirical social science and covers historical materialism, class,
  capital, labor, value, crisis, ideology, and alienation. Additional sections
  include Labor, Class, and Social Divisions; Capitalist States and Spaces;
  Accumulation, Crisis, and Class Struggle in the Core Countries; Accumulation,
  Crisis, and Class Struggle in the Peripheral and Semi-Peripheral Countries;
  and Alternatives to Capitalism.%

    Debate and deliberation play essential roles in politics and government,
  but most models presume that debates are won mainly via superior style or
  agenda control. Ideally, however, debates would be won on the merits, as a
  function of which side has the stronger arguments. We propose a predictive
  model of debate that estimates the effects of linguistic features and the
  latent persuasive strengths of different topics, as well as the interactions
  between the two. Using a dataset of 118 Oxford-style debates, our model's
  combination of content (as latent topics) and style (as linguistic features)
  allows us to predict audience-adjudicated winners with 74\% accuracy,
  significantly outperforming linguistic features alone (66\%). Our model finds
  that winning sides employ stronger arguments, and allows us to identify the
  linguistic features associated with strong or weak arguments.%

    Feuerbach is now recognized as a central figure in the history of
  nineteenth-century thought. He was one of Hegel's most influential pupils: he
  dominated German radical philosophy in the 1840s and was the leader of the
  Young Hegelians; his 'anthropological' critique of Hegel's idealism
  decisively influences the materialism and humanism of Marx and Engels; his
  critique of religion pointed the way for the philosophers of religion; and
  his psychological analyses found a place in Freudian thought and the
  existential and phenomenological traditions. In this 1977 text, Professor
  Wartofsky wishes to go beyond this conventional view to establish Feuerbach
  as much more than a transitional figure between Hegel and Marx or an
  influence on important later developments. He seriously considers Feuerbach's
  philosophy on its own terms and seeks to demonstrate its continuing
  importance. He therefore traces Feuerbach's development in detail,
  emphasizing its dialectical character, and finds fundamental originality in
  his epistemology.%

    In this paper, we introduce personalized word embeddings, and examine their
  value for language modeling. We compare the performance of our proposed
  prediction model when using personalized versus generic word representations,
  and study how these representations can be leveraged for improved

  accurately predicted when building personalized models. Our results show that
  a subset of words belonging to specific psycholinguistic categories tend to
  vary more in their representations across users and that combining generic

    In vivid detail, Francis Wheen tells the story of Das Kapital and Karl
  Marx’s twenty-year struggle to complete his unfinished masterpiece. Born in
  a two-room flat in London’s Soho amid political squabbles and personal
  tragedy, the first volume of Das Kapital was published in 1867, to muted
  praise. But after Marx’s death, the book went on to influence thinkers,
  writers, and revolutionaries, from George Bernard Shaw to V. I. Lenin,
  changing the direction of twentieth-century history. Wheen’s captivating,
  accessible book shows that, far from being a dry economic treatise, Das
  Kapital is like a vast Gothic novel whose heroes are enslaved by the monster
  they created: capitalism. Furthermore, Wheen argues, as long as capitalism
  endures, Das Kapital demands to be read and understood.%

    Marx and Russia is a chronological account of the evolution of Marxist

  of Marxist thinking in the revolutionary era in Russia.Starting from Marx's
  own connections with Russian revolutionaries and scholars, James D. White
  examines the contributions of such figures as Sieber, Plekhanov, Lenin,
  Bogdanov, Trotsky, Bukharin and Stalin to Marxist ideology in Russia. Using
  primary documents, biographical sketches and a helpful timeline, the book
  provides a useful guide for students to orientate themselves among the
  various Marxist ideologies which they encounter in modern Russian history.
  White also incorporates valuable new research for Russian history specialists
  in a vital volume for anyone interested in the history of Marxism, Soviet
  history and the history of Russia across the modern period.%

    Text has always been an important data source in political science. What
  has changed in recent years is the feasibility of investigating large amounts
  of text quantitatively. The internet provides political scientists with more
  data than their mentors could have imagined, and the research community is
  providing accessible text analysis software packages, along with training and
  support. As a result, text-as-data research is becoming mainstream in
  political science. Scholars are tapping new data sources, they are employing
  more diverse methods, and they are becoming critical consumers of findings
  based on those methods. In this article, we first describe the four stages of
  a typical text-as-data project. We then review recent political science
  applications and explore one important methodological challenge—topic model
  instability—in greater detail.%

    Modeling what makes a request persuasive—eliciting the desired response
  from a reader—is critical to the study of propaganda, behavioral economics,
  and advertising. Yet current models can’t quantify the persuasiveness of
  requests or extract successful persuasive strategies. Building on theories of
  persuasion, we propose a neural network to quantify persuasiveness and
  identify the persuasive strategies in advocacy requests. Our semi-supervised
  hierarchical neural network model is supervised by the number of people
  persuaded to take actions and partially supervised at the sentence level with
  human-labeled rhetorical strategies. Our method outperforms several
  baselines, uncovers persuasive strategies—offering increased
  interpretability of persuasive speech—and has applications for other
  situations with document-level supervision but only partial sentence
  supervision.%

    In our world with full of uncertainty, debates and argumentation contribute
  to the progress of science and society. Despite of the increasing attention
  to characterize human arguments, most progress made so far focus on the
  debate outcome, largely ignoring the dynamic patterns in argumentation
  processes. This paper presents a study that automatically analyzes the key
  factors in argument persuasiveness, beyond simply predicting who will
  persuade whom. Specifically, we propose a novel neural model that is able to
  dynamically track the changes of latent topics and discourse in argumentative
  conversations, allowing the investigation of their roles in influencing the
  outcomes of persuasion. Extensive experiments have been conducted on
  argumentative conversations on both social media and supreme court. The
  results show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art models in
  identifying persuasive arguments via explicitly exploring dynamic factors of
  topic and discourse. We further analyze the effects of topics and discourse
  on persuasiveness, and find that they are both useful — topics provide
  concrete evidence while superior discourse styles may bias participants,
  especially in social media arguments. In addition, we draw some findings from
  our empirical results, which will help people better engage in future
  persuasive conversations.%
